Running for office is hard work – the outdated software that runs campaigns makes it even harder. We believe it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why we built Numero, a modern financial platform that Democratic elected officials and candidates at all levels of public office can use to manage the $4.5 billion in annual contributions to their political campaigns.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re a team of technologists, software engineers, and financial professionals who previously founded several startups and managed a run for Congress.

We've also just launched Electables – a grassroots fundraising platform that rewards donors' support with unique digital collectibles. Some of the exciting projects we’re working on include:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Algorithms to match and cleanse contact data to help our clients manage relationships and stay compliant with campaign finance limits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A custom querying language (dubbed “NumeroQL”) that enables flexible real-time search, allowing campaigns to quickly generate lists and reports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Secure data pipelines that import and standardize contribution data to give our clients a real-time snapshot of their fundraising performance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Calltime Mode™️ that enables candidates and their staff to effortlessly coordinate donor outreach and fundraising while working together and on the go.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Standardized integrations with third party platforms, enabling our customers to flexibly manage their data across all the tools that they use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Scaling our GraphQL API backend to serve ever more frontend clients (including a React native mobile app, our web app, and a few Next.JS apps).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h1\"><br>Who We’re Looking For</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re looking for engineers who have at least 3 years of professional software engineering experience and for whom the following values and concepts resonate:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">💡 <strong>Eager, excited mentors.</strong> You are excited to work on a variety of products and help level up your teammates who work on different parts of the stack.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">💁 <strong>Customer-first orientation.</strong> You empathize with our clients’ needs and you care about building things the right way in order to create experiences that people will love.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">📡 <strong>Clear, thoughtful communication.</strong> You know that having everyone on the same page is critical for success and openly share your ideas and concerns with your teammates!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">🤸🏾‍♂️ <strong>Conscientious + Flexible.</strong> As a remote team, we all have different working styles, and we encourage you to find the balance that suits you best.

We’re all learners at heart and happily invest in our teammates through mentorship, pair programming, and projects that grow their technical skills.

Inspired by the current state of politics, people from every background imaginable have stepped up to run, including our CEO, Brian, who ran for Congress in 2018. Our other two co-founders, Susie and Karan, led the finance and technology arms of his campaign. They learned firsthand the painful process of manually stitching together critical finance and compliance data using outdated campaign software.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staff, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In our first three years, we’ve already helped more than 300 campaigns manage over $1 billion in contributions. The US has more than 500,000 elected officials, and many more candidates run for office at all levels of government.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Who We Are</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our CEO, Brian, was a Senior Tech Advisor in the Obama White House, taught at MIT, and co-founded one of the largest phone companies in Nicaragua. Our CTO, Karan, oversaw the technical infrastructure of 80 campaigns last cycle and is a 3x startup CTO. Our CFO, Susie, was the Corporate VP of Finance &amp; Accounting for AECOM, an 87,000-person company.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We believe our democracy is strongest when it’s represented by the diversity of our country. Similarly, we believe the strength of our company will come from the diversity of our employees – that's why we've worked hard to ensure that our cap table is fully diverse and that half of our angel investors are women. If you share our values and enthusiasm for strengthening our democracy, you’ll feel at home at Numero!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Interested?</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To apply, submit the application below sharing a bit about why you're excited to work at Numero, your resume, and links to any public online profiles (e.g. Github, LinkedIn, etc) you’d like to share.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If it seems like we might be a good fit, we’ll schedule a quick 30 minute call to chat about your past work and go from there. <strong>Go for it!
