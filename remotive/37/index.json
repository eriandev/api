But one of the most challenging elements of owning an electric vehicle is its charging and that’s where we come in.</p>\n<p>We set up in 2018 to make EV charging simple, green and low cost for drivers, to encourage EV adoption and reduce carbon emissions from transport. Core to our platform is a proprietary smart-charging algorithm, dynamically aligning charging with intermittent low-carbon electricity, reducing carbon emissions from grid electricity by as much as 70%. We've so far secured over 13 million USD in funding, have over 100k drivers using our app, and were named 'Best Energy Startup in the World' when we won the Free Electrons programme.</p>\n<p>To achieve all of this, we gathered a great team bringing expertise from their previous roles at National Grid, Bulb, BBOX, Powervault, BCG, Starling, and more. We're now over 70 people working fully remotely across Europe and North America, and pride ourselves on our inclusive and collaborative culture.</p>\n<p>We're aiming to have over a million drivers using our product, and we're looking for even more talented and passionate folk to join our mission.</p>\n<p><strong>The role</strong></p>\n<p>Our Driver team is looking for a hands-on, self-motivated Product Designer to work on our solar product.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We’ve developed our solar feature to the point of MVP stage - we’re now ready to progress to full development and feature expansion.
