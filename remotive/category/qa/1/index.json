As our team and customer base grow, we are looking for the next QA Tester to join our team and continue building an excellent QA process together. We strive to automate most of the mundane parts of QA testing, and currently use a mix of manual and automated testing. </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Collaborating with the engineering team in releasing exciting new features, and investigating bugs for the customer support team are our main priorities. One of the best parts of my job is building trusting relationships with our engineers, and feeling like I have a direct impact on making our product not only usable for our customers but beloved by them!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You might be the perfect match for our team if:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are detail-oriented and are an excellent communicator - someone who is committed to creating great collaborations with engineers and customer service</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are terrific at time management and taking initiative, being able to think outside of the box to find solutions</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You can scale up your knowledge of the Ashby product systematically and document workflows for easily reproducible QA. You love to learn!</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are passionate about the customer experience and ensuring it’s constantly exceeding expectations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Bonus</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You have experience working with a complex and technical product</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are familiar with automation and creating automated tests</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You can use SQL and similarly advanced methods for debugging</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>What We’re Building</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">At Ashby, we’re improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We have many customers who love us, and we have great investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Our Culture</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our team culture is motivated by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Abhik</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Benji’s</u></a> (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Collaboration is Natural, Communication is Deliberate</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our team consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is sacred, and individual contributors have less than 2 hours of meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>). </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Give Ownership &amp; Autonomy</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our culture reflects the experience of having a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution: individual contributors, including engineers, own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it. </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Put Effort into Diversity </strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Diverse teams <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>. Having built my career as a woman in non-diverse fields, I am fully invested in making sure Ashby creates opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Today, 39% of Ashby identifies as women or non-binary, 10% from underrepresented ethnic groups in tech. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Interview Process</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and get an idea of your approach to QA by having you record a QA process for part of our product. Our interview process is three rounds:</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">45-minute introduction call</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A take-home assignment where you will document a QA workflow (4 hours max)</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A meeting with a cofounder (30 minutes)</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A virtual on-site of 2 hours and 30 minutes (can be split across two days)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You can get a product demo as early as the introductory call. During the interview process, you’ll meet a co-founder plus 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Benefits</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Competitive salary and equity.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget.

We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up.
