Understanding how a developer's code changes the data, and coming up with new tests, using this knowledge, that may reveal a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Looking at server error logs to determine if a test is failing silently, or creating output in the error log that may reveal a new area that can be tested to identify a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Look at the Javascript browser console to find errors that code may be silently generating, that could reveal a bug or other potential problem.</li> </ul><p><strong>Company Culture</strong></p><p>You'll work with a talented and highly-motivated team that is friendly, fast-moving, self-managing, and highly capable with a sense of humor. Our team's family time is important; we won't typically require long hours when we can avoid it, which is almost always. </p><p>Our entire team works remotely using Slack for casual interaction, ­so you can live practically anywhere in the world if you have an Internet connection. There's no micro-­management here—we trust that you will see tasks through to completion and communicate with your fellow team members when needed or ask for help when needed.</p><p>At Defiant, ‘trust’ is the attribute we value most highly among our team members.
