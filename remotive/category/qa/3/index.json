This may require some research on your part, working with the CS team to understand what the customer reported, and finding out how to reproduce the issue. </li> <li style=\"\">Verify fixes that have been implemented by the dev team and deployed to our staging environment.

What we mean by this is, rather than testing the minimum requirements when verifying a bug, we expect our analysts to come up with creative tests that may reveal problems in new code. This requires anticipating ways that a fix may affect other parts of an application or data. </p><p>Specific skills and activities that help with our approach of \"testing broadly\" are:</p><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Looking at the PHP code in a pull request, that a developer has implemented, to understand what changed, and get an idea of what else a code change may break, then testing those parts of a system.</li> <li style=\"\">Using a SQL client to access the database that an application is interacting with and looking at the table structure and data. Understanding how a developer's code changes the data, and coming up with new tests, using this knowledge, that may reveal a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Looking at server error logs to determine if a test is failing silently, or creating output in the error log that may reveal a new area that can be tested to identify a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Look at the Javascript browser console to find errors that code may be silently generating, that could reveal a bug or other potential problem.</li> </ul><p><strong>Company Culture</strong></p><p>You'll work with a talented and highly-motivated team that is friendly, fast-moving, self-managing, and highly capable with a sense of humor. Our team's family time is important; we won't typically require long hours when we can avoid it, which is almost always. </p><p>Our entire team works remotely using Slack for casual interaction, ­so you can live practically anywhere in the world if you have an Internet connection. There's no micro-­management here—we trust that you will see tasks through to completion and communicate with your fellow team members when needed or ask for help when needed.</p><p>At Defiant, ‘trust’ is the attribute we value most highly among our team members. We need to know that you can grab a task, communicate clearly with stakeholders, and see the task to completion with superb attention to detail.</p><p>We use apps like Slack, FogBugz, GitHub, and Google Apps for our workflow.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p>The Required Skills for this role are:</p><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Experience working as a QA Analyst.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience filing bugs and verifying fixes in a bug tracking system like Fogbugz.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience verifying bugs in a testing or staging environment, and sending them back to dev with helpful feedback, or marking them as fixed.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience testing PHP web applications.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience testing browser-based Javascript code.</li> <li style=\"\">Familiarity with accessing a SQL database using a SQL client, and knowledge of basic SQL is required.</li> <li style=\"\">Familiarity with Git and GitHub is required.

You will not be expected to commit code.</li> </ul><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Experience with Linux command line, command line tools, and using SSH.</li> <li style=\"\">Ability to read PHP code.
