Well, there is - strength-training!</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>At Fitbod, we’re not just focused on the advanced gym-goer. Rather, our product can unlock functional movement, strength, flexibility, and freedom from pain for millions of people. Our aim is to create “<a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://peterattiamd.com/move-defines-live/\" rel=\"nofollow\">athletes of life</a>” - to push, pull, carry, and move well before - and crucially after - our best shape.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>How?
