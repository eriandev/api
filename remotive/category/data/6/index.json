We are working in numerous ways to help put our neutral information in front of people at the times when they most need it, including on mobile phones while you’re standing in the voting booth. We firmly believe that our readers, and the mindset we help them cultivate, are essential in a world where too many others are fighting to get us all addicted to sensational posts and the irrational decisions they foster.</p>\n<p>If this is a mission you’d be willing to work hard to achieve, and if this is a team you’d be willing to work hard with—JOIN US.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1503053/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1506049,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/data/data-engineer-external-1506049","title":"Data Engineer-External","company_name":"Cover Whale","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1506049/logo","category":"Data","tags":["api","AWS","devops","hadoop","linux","python","sql","management","operations","research","product management","Engineering","product","analytics","deployment","data","troubleshooting","spark","business","ETL","leadership","debugging","APIs","writing","learning","law","communication","architecture ","insurance"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2022-12-02T23:40:09","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<p><strong>What We’re Looking For:</strong></p><p>Cover Whale is searching for a Data Engineer to join our rapidly growing Data team.
