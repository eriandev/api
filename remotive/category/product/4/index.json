Attio is revolutionizing the most important aspect of any business: our customer relationships.</p>\n<p>As more and more of our interactions move to the digital world, traditional business software has failed to adapt. It has remained essentially unchanged for the last decade. Most data entry is manual, intelligent data analysis is non-existent, and they're a challenge for users to set up.</p>\n<p>We believe the future of CRM should be simple, powerful and entirely customizable: cutting-edge, consumer-grade designed software combined with enterprise-grade power to make software work for your unique business needs.</p>\n<p>Your relationship software should automatically know your contacts and analyze your communications. Your data should be easily viewed, sorted, and filtered depending on your task. Integrations and automations should be customizable and quick.

Everyone on the team is welcome to question any aspect of the business and build greater understanding and input.</p>\n<p>Through Ownership teams are responsible not just for the technical aspects of their work but also their own product and roadmap decisions.

While there will be an opportunity to do some simple prototyping and web design within this job, this is <em>not </em>a design position or a programming position. Instead, your main focus will be to plan, guide and supervise feature development from conception through launch, and to assist in promoting the value of those features to existing and prospective clients.<br><br>In a typical day, you'll be managing the development of multiple new features, each at different stages of completion.
