The passion for music and the excitement for innovative technology have proven to make a good combination.</p>\n<p>We say there’s a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately). Our way of being is always sprinkled with <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bmat.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">transparency, perseverance, flexibility, open-mindedness and trustworthiness</a>.</p>\n<p>BMAT has grown as a company of companies. Within BMAT there are a number of products and services that developed semi autonomously for different players – Digital Service Providers, Publishers and Collective Management Organisations.</p>\n<p><em>Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life.
