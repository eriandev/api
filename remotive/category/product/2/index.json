It is an all-in-one tool that supports both the creative and process-oriented aspects of military planning. In Onebrief, planners use maps, boards, diagrams, timelines, spreadsheets, slide decks and text documents to create their plans—all while sharing a common database. Everything stays in sync, in real time. Our approach has been refined and validated through hundreds of user experiments.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re post-revenue ($3M+ in ARR). We are backed by Y Combinator (S21) and top-tier VCs, including Caffeinated Capital (Affirm, Docker, Notion, and more). Our elite team combines the best of tech and military talent, including education and experience at Google, Adobe, MIT, Delta Force, TOPGUN, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Given our current traction we can barely keep up with demand.

Starting with opportunities identified with our leadership team, you will refine the problem definition, design a high-level solution, mitigate risks and assumption, and establish hard “no-gos,” to make sure that the project can be executed successfully with virtually no risk to schedule.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Shaped bets are rough and unfinished, but they are painstakingly thought through. All the main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together. The work isn’t specified down to individual tasks, but the overall solution is spelled out. While surprises might still happen, any open questions or rabbit holes we could see up front have been removed to reduce the project’s risk. Shaping bets involves equal parts of product, design and engineering work.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You will have the opportunity to travel and partner with military planners from around the world, empathize with their needs, and translate that into informed product bets.
