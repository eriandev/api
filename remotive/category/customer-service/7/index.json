Our trajectory is fueled by top investors like Founder's Fund, Stripe, General Catalyst, Caffeinated Capital, 8vc, Elad Gil, among other great angels.

We need people who aren’t just interested in working at a startup; we need people who are excited about building a great company. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Ego-less Learner</strong> -- Every day at Pulley, we are trying things that we’ve never done before - sometimes they work; sometimes they don’t. To be successful here, you need to embrace that feeling of ‘being a beginner’ and be willing to accept feedback in stride. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Less Talk; More Action</strong> -- Everyone rolls up our sleeves at Pulley. If your strength is being the ‘idea gal or guy’ but you don’t create your own slides or write your own code, then we are not a great fit.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Prioritize ruthlessly</strong> - Our view is that being a <a href=\"https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>10x engineer</u></a> is not about writing more code; it’s about making the right decision on what to build. We’re hiring for people who can make the right strategic decisions on where to spend their time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/21-Great_Workplace_isStunning_ColleaguesGreat_workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>stunning colleagues</u></a>.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If you like the sound of our environment and you’re passionate about joining a team like the one we’ve described, we'd love to talk!</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1444043/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1444452,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/customer-support/customer-success-champion-1444452","title":"Customer Success Champion","company_name":"Photobooth Supply Co","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1444452/logo","category":"Customer Service","tags":["education","ios","sales","management","strategy","customer success","customer service","business","account management","onboarding","chat","engagement","IT","macOS","hubspot","communication","webinars","software"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2022-10-27T03:39:10","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<p>We call this position a \"Customer Success Champion” because it's your job to do just that: champion and lead our customers to success.

Your working hours will need to overlap with that window, as you’ll have a designated shift during those hours.</strong> </li> <li>You're empathetic and can acknowledge the customer's feelings <em>before</em> jumping into solution mode. Your interactions with customers make them feel confident and empowered.</li> <li>You love to solve problems. Regardless of the customer, situation, or circumstance, you enjoy learning about the issue and following through proactively until there's a resolution.</li> <li>You realize the impact a word, phrase, or emoji can have on a situation, and that a few words of encouragement or a moment to connect on a human level can have a profound impact on someone's experience.</li> <li>When you notice something is wrong, you default to action and demonstrate great followthrough to make sure it gets fixed.</li> </ul><div class=\"h3\">Things You Might Do...</div><ul> <li>Spend 30-35 hours in the queue on a weekly basis, providing fast, accurate, and personalized responses to customer inquiries through both phone and text-based support.</li> <li>Continuously help to improve Ness by recommending process improvements, contributing to task guides, working on cross-functional projects, and championing initiatives to improve how, when, and why customers receive support.</li> <li>Solve customer issues by developing expertise across our internal processes and systems as well as our third-party tools.</li> <li>Nurture relationships with customers by proactively engaging with them (handwritten cards, personalized videos, impromptu emails and check-ins, etc).</li> <li>Proactively spot patterns in the frustrations or hopes of our customers, and work cross-functionally to see where we can change our processes, tools, or product to make them happier.</li> <li>Own every customer experience, using the tools at your disposal to solve issues quickly and independently, and rely on your teammates to help sort through more complex issues.</li> </ul><div class=\"h3\">How We Hire</div><p>First, we don't discriminate. We know from experience a more diverse and inclusive team leads to bigger impact and success.</p><p><strong>1. First Hello</strong></p><p>You'll talk to Louisa, one of our early Support team members.</p><p>First, we want to figure out if you've got the right experience for this position and working at Ness is a fit for you and us. We'll have reviewed your application and resume in detail, so this discussion will be mostly a \"behavioral\" interview focused on what you've done before. We want to build conviction you'll succeed in this job the same way you've succeeded in the past.</p><p>Then, you'll have time to ask us anything! (Well, mostly anything.)</p><p><strong>2. Take-Home</strong></p><p>After this, we'll send you a take-home project, similar to what would be expected of you at Ness, to get a sense of how you think and communicate!</p><p>Why? Well, we believe one of the best ways to evaluate your fit for the role is to give you a practical assessment that comes close to what you would be expected to do day-to-day. We'll share more details about this when we get there!</p><p>You'll have 3 days to complete the take-home (~1.5-2 hours of work) and send it back to us, and then we'll take the opportunity to review it.</p><p><strong>3. Meet the Manager</strong></p><p>You’ll have a 30-minute video call with the manager for this role. We’ll have reviewed your take-home project and will ask you some questions about it. We’ll also dig deeper into your past experience. Our goal is to assess if you’re the right fit for the role.</p><p>You’ll also have plenty of time to ask us any questions you have. We want you to feel completely comfortable with the expectations and environment for this role at Ness!</p><p><strong>4. Meet the Team</strong></p><p>You'll talk to another one of our team members for 30 minutes and our CEO &amp; Founder, <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/derekflanzraich/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Derek</a>, on a 30-minute video call.</p><p>Here, we want to explore if we're a good fit for each other. We will have reviewed your application, take-home, and any prior meeting notes in detail, so the discussion will be focused mostly on what brings out the best in you and what's next. We want to be confident Ness can offer the environment (culture, responsibility, org structure, etc...) that's led you to the most professional success so far.</p><p>You'll have time to ask questions, too!</p><p><strong>5. References</strong></p><p>Oh—and, with your help, we'll reach out to folks you've worked with in the past. We're usually pretty far along here, so this is mostly about learning from outside perspectives about how to manage and empower you best.</p><p>If relevant, we might have you also meet some other folks on the team. This can be a great opportunity to get a better feel for us and for us to get a better feel for you!</p><p><strong>6. The Job Offer</strong></p><p>Got this far? That means you're in. Expect a personal call and welcome to the team!</p><p><em>No recruiters or agencies, please. Thanks!</em></p><p><em>Please be aware of fake job offers coming from people claiming to be Ness Well, Inc. employees.
