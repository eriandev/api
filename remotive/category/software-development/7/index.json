To improve application performance, we implement caching using <strong>Redis</strong>.

In a bundle with Consul, NGINX balances the traffic among several microservices instances according to setup configurations. <br><br>Massive volumes of data are stored in numerous <strong>MSSQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> relational databases. Since our website is a search engine, we use <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> to access data quickly. Along with Elasticsearch, we use other instruments of Elastic Stack. For example, Logstash and Kibana allow keeping an eye on error logs of our software. <br><br>Together with DevOps, our Developers implement the best CI/CD practices using <strong>GitLab</strong> and <strong>Jenkins</strong>. Using <strong>Prometheus</strong>, we gather performance metrics of our services and applications and then visualize them on <strong>Grafana</strong> dashboards.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Development culture at Jooble</strong></div>\n<p>At Jooble, we strive to create high-quality code.

And on <strong>Product Sprint Demos</strong>, we sync on the overall progress of the whole product. We carefully track the progress on tasks in <strong>Jira</strong>, which provides clarity and transparency of the development process.
