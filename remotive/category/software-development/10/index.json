All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world‚Äôs most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio.
