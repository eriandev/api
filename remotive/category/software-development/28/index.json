Everything we do is aligned with our collective vision of a future world where <strong>all people develop the inner resources to cultivate happiness</strong>. Our mission is to help people see more clearly what leads to happiness (and what doesn't) by supporting the initiation and deepening of our customers' meditation practice.</p>\n<p>We work towards our vision of the world everyday through six shared values:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Human First.</strong> We deeply care for each other, and we're unafraid of bringing this care into our work. We see, support, and celebrate each other as humans - flaws and all - with grace and compassion.</li><li><strong>Own Your Shit.</strong> We name our foibles, allowing us to work with them, rather than being driven blindly by them.</li><li><strong>Say The Hard Thing.</strong> We owe it to each other to speak up. Hard feedback, delivered skillfully, helps our colleagues grow and is great for business.</li><li><strong>Don't Side With Yourself.</strong> We have a deeply rooted tendency to cling to our views. We strive to escape our subjectivity and appreciate other perspectives.</li><li><strong>Build More Skateboards.</strong> Innovation requires rapid iteration and failure. World-changing ideas always start out woefully inadequate, even embarrassing. When we understand this, we stop criticizing the skateboards and start extending trust.</li><li><strong>For Us All.</strong> We welcome the innate value that comes from diverse experiences.
