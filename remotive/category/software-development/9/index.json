To power the next generation of the internet and drive mainstream adoption, we need to meet or surpass the scale and quality of service we have in today's internet.

We do this by orchestrating a decentralized network of GPU-powered nodes that run the Mawari Engine, a proprietary technology stack that allows to render interactive 3D content and stream  it efficiently in real-time to mobile XR devices at scale.
