This squad is made up of the Hub Frontend and Hub Backend pods, along with a new Agency Partner Enablement Pod being formed currently. There will be approximately 12 engineers in the squad initially and we may look to grow that number in the future.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You will play the internal role of a Squad Leader (based on the<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Spotify Model</a>).
