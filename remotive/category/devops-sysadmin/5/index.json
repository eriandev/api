Isovalent builds open-source software and enterprise solutions solving networking, security, and observability needs for modern cloud native infrastructure. The flagship technology, Cilium, is the choice of leading global organizations, including Adobe, AWS, Capital One, Datadog, GitLab, Google, and many more. Isovalent is headquartered in Mountain View, CA and is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and Cisco Investments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h4\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About The Role</strong></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Customer Reliability Engineer (CRE), you are the tip of the spear in interacting with our customers. Our CRE team adapts the best practices of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and applies them to our customers. As part of the role, you will gain a deep understanding of our customers, their architecture down into their various configurations. The main mission of this role is to ensure that our customers can continue running Cilium Enterprise, reliably, at scale. You will work with various stakeholders, internally and externally to provide world class support and issue resolution to various incidents and enhance our organization’s view into the health of our various customers. This role take a proactive approach vs a reactive approach to customer reliability and you will use existing data to help us and our customers be aware of upcoming reliability risks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Core Values</strong></div>\n<div class=\"h3\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Mutual Respect</strong></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Respect leads to trust, trust leads to a working environment that is safe to grow and innovate in. Mutual respect is at the heart of everything we do on a daily basis. We respect all opinions. We listen. We respect the boundaries of everyone and understand that they are different for everyone. We are inclusive in everything we do. Not everyone feels the same way about speaking up in a meeting. We respect that and find ways to include everybody to not lose a single drop of wisdom. We respect people having different hours where they are most productive. We help each other out even if something is not going according to plan. We understand that this trust and respect will always be mutual.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Open-Source &amp; Transparency</strong></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company’s engineering culture has grown from years of open-source culture. Openness and transparency are central to the success of our engineering team. This influences everything from committing to an open-source business model and maximizing the amount of code we open-source while guaranteeing business success, transparency, and inclusion in all decision making, all the way to an open debating culture where expressing different perspectives and opinions is encouraged and safe.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Work - Adventure Balance</strong></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A startup with talented engineers can be challenging. A lot is going on. Almost everything we do is highly visible by the public. Everything is fast moving and the next big success and big impact moment is always just a sprint away. That can be incredibly exciting and rewarding for you individually and for the entire team. At the same time, it is also demanding and it will draw energy. Cherish the rewarding moments, fight hard for them but also take time to recharge and balance your life. There is no single recipe for great balance, you have to find and maintain it individually. We are here to support each other in that personal balance.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Personal Growth</strong></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What growth means exactly will be different for all of us. It may involve growing your technical skills, achieving projects to inspire others or get recognized in the broader open-source community, growing your non-technical skills, working more with other peers and achieving more as a team, leveling-up your compensation, or achieving the ideal work - life balance you always wanted. Your goals are individual and as Isovalent we will do our best to help you achieve your personal growth goals, as individual as they might be.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Your Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reduce our customers’ production operational anxiety to near zero</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Collaborate with our solutions architects and engineering team to provide resolution to customer incidents</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Develop knowledge base articles that would help our customers accelerate time to resolution of previously identified issues</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Collaborate with our documentation team to promote any existing knowledge base articles to our official documentation site</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Conduct production readiness reviews with customer success team members and customers as they prepare to go to production</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Leverage data to assess any reliability impact to our customer base and provide critical communication to customers around Cilium Enterprise to maintain high level of production reliability</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Create new customer reproduction environments and when necessary enhance existing or create new automation modules</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lead retrospective activities for high severity customer incidents</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why We Hope You Will Join Us</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">100% OSS company with decades of experience contributing to open source projects</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are founded by the creators of Cilium and eBPF.
