We help our customers build, document, automate, and track recurring workflows. Our platform stores knowledge where the action happens, ensuring thorough and error free execution of workflows that our global customers run their businesses on. We service over 3k customers around the world, such as Airbnb, Spotify, AstraZeneca, and Accenture, and are VC-backed by Accel, Salesforce, and Atlassian.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong></p>\n<p>To make recurring work fun, fast, and faultless for teams everywhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Culture:</strong></p>\n<p>Process Street was founded on a strong belief in the work-life benefits of a healthy, collaborative remote culture. We value flexibility because many of us are parents, travelers, or just creatives who aren't inspired by the construct of a mundane 9-to-5. Spread across 9 different time zones, we communicate asynchronously, work autonomously, and take real ownership of our work. We know human connections are what make teams strong, so we regularly do coffee chats, game-playing, story-telling, and more, to build strong relationships.</p>\n<p>If you’re entrepreneurial and seek an environment that values impact, ownership, and flexibility we look forward to meeting you! </p>\n<p><strong>The Opportunity:</strong></p>\n<p>The Sales Development Representative is an exciting commercial development opportunity that will report into our Director of Sales.

We regularly do coffee chats, game-playing, story-telling, house tours (only if you're comfortable), and more to build connections.</li>\n<li><strong>Generous health insurance</strong> for US employees and their families, including dental and vision plans.</li>\n<li><strong>Equity</strong> for all full-time roles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Confidence can sometimes hold us back from applying for a job. But we'll let you in on a secret: there's no such thing as a 'perfect' candidate. Research tells us that applicants who are female, non-binary, or people of color are less likely to apply to a role if they feel they don’t meet every qualification. If you feel you meet <em>most</em> of the qualifications, regardless of how you identify, and this is a role that would make you excited to come into work every day, please apply! Process Street is a place where everyone can grow.</p>\n<p>We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to equal opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, gender, gender identity, genetic information, parental or pregnancy status, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, or Veteran status.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1438341/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1427592,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/sales/methodiq-sales-development-representative-1427592","title":"Methodiq Sales Development Representative","company_name":"Gistia","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1427592/logo","category":"Sales","tags":["legal","machine learning","marketing","sales","social media","management","operations","networking","email","content","Engineering","product","CRM","healthcare","data","software development","business","inbound","hiring","sales development","culture","events","development","IT","SDR","hubspot","learning","media","IT operations","revenue","sales operations","software"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2022-10-19T11:40:15","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<p>Methodiq powers the digital transformation of diagnostic laboratories, bringing them into the modern era and allowing them better IT operations to secure more revenue.
