In the United States alone over 150 million people lack access to reliable internet connectivity. Globally, over 3 billion people lack access to reliable internet connectivity. The past few years have highlighted just how significant this problem is. Young school children are expected to do more schoolwork than ever online and learn remotely, yet 40% of schools in America lack broadband access for students and educators. The popularity and necessity of telehealth has been magnified, yet 60% of hospitals outside of metro areas do not have broadband access.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Our purpose</strong><br></p>\n<p>Our teams are on a mission to accelerate digital equality, connect communities, and empower people. That's why we come to work every day. Thousands of people in the fiber broadband industry have been working diligently to close the digital divide for years, and that impact is finally gaining some serious momentum behind the events of a global pandemic and a wave of funding opportunities in the United States and dozens of other countries around the world. Being problem solvers and innovators are what we're known for in the market and we leverage that mindset every day to push our teams, our partners, and the market to think differently and more efficiently about the challenges facing our industry.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Our team</strong><br><br>Our culture is a focal point in our hiring process. We support diverse people, thinking, backgrounds, and experiences because we prove every day that an inclusive workplace makes all of us better in and out of work. We like to be challenged. We need to be challenged. It's an everyday mission to make a meaningful impact towards digital equality and there is no one perfect answer to the challenge. If we want to say we are building the airplane while we're flying it then it is fair to say we trust our partners to be building the control tower while controlling the airspace and paving the runway while telling us we are clear to land. It's a team sport within our company and between all of our partners in the industry, and just like high performing sports teams we are building a culture where everyone knows how to execute the right plays at the right times. That takes hard work and a willingness to wear different hats to match the different scenarios that may get thrown at us on any given day.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p><p>If you have made it this far then things are already looking up. We are very excited to find the perfect Senior Account Executive to help us grow our customer base in the industry by leveraging our truly world class brand loyalty, our innovative approach to design, and your skills and experiences as an enterprise sales professional to help us grow our impact. The fiber industry is experiencing a tremendous amount of growth with private and public money flowing in to help fund the planning and construction of networks. We are investing heavily in the areas of sales and marketing to reach more of the potential market and expand our value proposition into new business areas.<br></p>\n<p>VETRO delivers the world's best map-based platform to plan, design, build and operate the physical telecommunications networks that enable a connected and sustainable world.<br></p>\n<p>We create Internet Infrastructure Intelligence.</p>\n<p>What does this mean? It means that you have the opportunity to work in a sales role that is actually making a real, measurable difference in the world. More than 22% of US households do not have home internet. Almost a quarter of US households have a significant socio-economic disadvantage because of this digital divide. So let's do something about it.</p>\n<p>VETRO has been working tirelessly for years to bridge the digital divide. Through the effects of the pandemic, this movement has recently gained massive momentum. Suddenly the entire world had to rely on working from home, telehealth, home-schooling, and more. A spotlight was shown on this internet infrastructure deficit.</p>\n<p>We are committed to our network owner-operator customers, to innovation, and to disrupting the fiber management software space </p>\n<p>as we strive to become \"The Digital Home for the Physical Internet\".  Now is an incredible time to join VETRO on this journey with unprecedented capital investment flowing into fiber network builds globally.</p>\n<p>The team behind the product is full of talented and dedicated professionals aligned in a mission to build truly innovative tooling to empower our customers.
