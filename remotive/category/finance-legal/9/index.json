You’ll join a team that is still below 100 people that passionately believes in the power of sharing ownership. This is a fantastic opportunity to really make your mark as we continue to scale up.</p>\n<p>As a legal tech business we support our clients in a number of different areas - not just share schemes, but also helping them through the implications of Shareholder Agreements, Articles of Associations, Investment Agreements, and company equity structures. Critically we are helping them with how all these elements interplay with the platform as they develop and grow.</p>\n<p>You will be interacting with customers as they work out how best to combine their current legal arrangements and corporate governance rules with our digital solutions. You will be helping us develop and map out the various digital support we can give to our customers (in respect of the various legal agreements).

Having had some exposure to share schemes is important, but is not a deal breaker.</p>\n<p>If you are still in a law firm, you will be frustrated by the pace of change and slow adoption of technology. You will be really keen to apply your knowledge and experience in a rapidly changing digital environment, that is on the cutting edge of what is possible.</p>\n<p>You will be inspired by the thought of helping to build a business that can really make a difference.
