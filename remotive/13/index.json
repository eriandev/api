We have gained a large following, thanks to our focus on Material Design fidelity, our obsession with details, on offering a large number of components, our community engagement, and by carefully improving the DX. Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source libraries to build their design system.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products. We released <a href=\"https://mui.com/x/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>MUI X</u></a>, a collection of advanced components; <a href=\"https://mui.com/design-kits/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>MUI Design kits</u></a>, the MUI components available for Figma, Sketch, etc.; and also host <a href=\"https://mui.com/templates/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Templates</u></a>, a set of pre-built UI kits. We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come. We are building <a href=\"https://mui.com/toolpad/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a low-code platform</u></a> for developers to significantly increase the speed and lower the barrier for creating simple CRUD/dashboard UIs with MUI.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones. We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration. Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work — the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us. For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our <a href=\"https://mui.com/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>careers</u></a> and <a href=\"https://mui.com/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>about</u></a> pages and also our <a href=\"https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>public Handbook</u></a>.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Why we're hiring</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).

More importantly, the challenges of developers and designers to solve when creating UIs go way beyond the ones of design systems. We envision a future where MUI becomes the default toolkit for web developers to create UIs. It's why we started MUI Base, Joy UI, and MUI Toolpad.
