We’re now over 160 people, spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Rio de Janeiro, London, Paris, New Jersey, Oslo, LA, Singapore, Tokyo, Manila, Bangkok and Lagos.</p>\n<p>We’re <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bmat.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a team of pretty decent people</a> who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music and the excitement for innovative technology have proven to make a good combination.</p>\n<p>We say there’s a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately). Our way of being is always sprinkled with <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bmat.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">transparency, perseverance, flexibility, open-mindedness and trustworthiness</a>.</p>\n<p>BMAT has grown as a company of companies. Within BMAT there are a number of products and services that developed semi autonomously for different players – Digital Service Providers, Publishers and Collective Management Organisations.</p>\n<p><em>Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1535670/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1537081,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/product/senior-product-manager-1537081","title":"Senior Product Manager","company_name":"3Pillar Global","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1537081/logo","category":"Product","tags":["excel","product manager","saas","growth","management","design","agile","content","strategy","product strategy","research","product management","Engineering","product","product development","analytics","healthcare","communications","data","retail","business","leadership","metrics","development","implementation","law","media"," team lead","financial services","organization","data-driven","revenue","banking","insurance","digital products","software"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2023-01-07T13:39:48","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<div><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Our Sr. Product Managers work closely with clients and cross-functional teams to build the right things, in the right way at all stages of the product life cycle.</span> <span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Senior Product Managers at 3Pillar have a track record of success delivering digital solutions at scale.
