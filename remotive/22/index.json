We believe that talented people can create cool projects no matter where they are. Yet if you like to work from the office – for all employees we have created closed corporate workspaces in Kyiv, Uzhgorod, and Lutsk that are free to be used anytime.</p>\n<p><strong>Our purpose</strong> — Help people all over the world find their dream jobs!</p>\n<p>Due to the constant development of the product, we want to strengthen our team with several <strong>.NET Developers</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Jooble's product from the technological perspective</strong></div>\n<p>Our website is built upon <strong>microservices architecture</strong>. We use the latest versions of <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> to create new services and applications. Message queuing with <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> allows transferring data between services and applications in the most effective way. To improve application performance, we implement caching using <strong>Redis</strong>. Our main front-end framework is react.js. To balance the load across multiple site instances, we use <strong>NGINX</strong>. In a bundle with Consul, NGINX balances the traffic among several microservices instances according to setup configurations. <br><br>Massive volumes of data are stored in numerous <strong>MSSQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> relational databases. Since our website is a search engine, we use <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> to access data quickly. Along with Elasticsearch, we use other instruments of Elastic Stack. For example, Logstash and Kibana allow keeping an eye on error logs of our software. <br><br>Together with DevOps, our Developers implement the best CI/CD practices using <strong>GitLab</strong> and <strong>Jenkins</strong>. Using <strong>Prometheus</strong>, we gather performance metrics of our services and applications and then visualize them on <strong>Grafana</strong> dashboards.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Development culture at Jooble</strong></div>\n<p>At Jooble, we strive to create high-quality code. Therefore, we follow coding standards agreed within the development team and conduct timely and effective <strong>code reviews</strong>. To ensure that our software meets business requirements, we apply <strong>TDD</strong>, <strong>DDD</strong>, and <strong>BDD</strong> techniques. Also, our developers often take part in pair/mob programming sessions to brainstorm ideas, design the best solutions, and share expertise within the team.<br><br>We regularly conduct Tech talks where we share knowledge on implementing new development approaches and solving challenging engineering issues. And on <strong>Product Sprint Demos</strong>, we sync on the overall progress of the whole product. We carefully track the progress on tasks in <strong>Jira</strong>, which provides clarity and transparency of the development process.

SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.</p>\n<p>At Metomic, we help tech companies save time &amp; reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio.
