We can help do the same for your career.</p>\n<p>We understand how crucial it is to make the right move at this stage of your career. You need more than a job description – you want to know what we stand for and whether Nine Feet Tall is a place where you can put down roots.</p>\n<p>We're a management consultancy that's helped customers deliver over £100m of value in the last sixteen years. Our core mission is to take the pain out of change, and to ease the transition to new ways of working.</p>\n<p>We use our core values to guide our decision making – acting with integrity and doing the right thing, always striving for excellence and delivering with real passion.</p>\n<p><strong>About you </strong></p>\n<p>Your career to date will have given you a solid background in leading business or IT transformation projects or managing change.</p>\n<p>You'll already know that you're a highly competent Project or Change Manager.
