STRV is a software design and engineering team that delivers next-level products. Here since 2004, we’ve delivered solutions for partners ranging from startups to enterprises, including Barry’s, Microsoft, MedMen, Barnes &amp; Noble, The Athletic, Autodesk, and more.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We focus on mobile applications, websites, backend infrastructure, IoT, blockchain, and data science/ML/AI. We have a footprint in specialized domains like dating, crypto, and mobile gaming. On top of that, we’ve also got some successful internal spin-off projects (like Surge and Zoe), with more in the works — including a space western multiplayer NFT game. Feel free to ask us all about them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The culture is very open and friendly, with everyone on the team self-driven in delivering the highest possible value for clients — because we all care about building partnerships and creating products that make us proud.

For people that decide to relocate to the Czech Republic, we’re always happy to provide visa sponsorships and relocation support. And as for meeting our US clients, there may be times you’ll get to visit them — or you may see them strolling through our Prague office since they’re often curious to see the STRV in action and to meet their team in person.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Learning &amp; Other Opportunities</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With over 9 designers, a team lead and a creative director, there’s always someone to consult, have a design feedback session with and learn from. We also host a couple of meetups and workshops, and our designers have a generous conference budget.
