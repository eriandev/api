One of the best parts of my job is building trusting relationships with our engineers, and feeling like I have a direct impact on making our product not only usable for our customers but beloved by them!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You might be the perfect match for our team if:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are detail-oriented and are an excellent communicator - someone who is committed to creating great collaborations with engineers and customer service</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are terrific at time management and taking initiative, being able to think outside of the box to find solutions</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You can scale up your knowledge of the Ashby product systematically and document workflows for easily reproducible QA.

We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We have many customers who love us, and we have great investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom.

These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is sacred, and individual contributors have less than 2 hours of meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>). </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Give Ownership &amp; Autonomy</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our culture reflects the experience of having a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution: individual contributors, including engineers, own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design.

You can get a product demo as early as the introductory call. During the interview process, you’ll meet a co-founder plus 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions).
