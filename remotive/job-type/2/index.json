href=\"%22https:/0x.org/%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">0x Labs</a>, our <a href=\"%22https:/blog.0x.org/the-0x-mission-and-values/%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">mission</a> is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. We’re a mission-driven and diverse team composed of world class talent from Coinbase, Google, Meta, Bitso, Citi, Spotify and other top companies. We are a remote-first and fully distributed company, with team members located across all of the continents besides Antarctica. As early pioneers in the space, we’ve made significant technical contributions to various Ethereum standards over the years; <em>fun fact - our team helped establish the NFT token standard (ERC721).</em></p>\n<p>In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2017, 0x Labs created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: the open-source, global backbone for decentralized exchange. Alongside the core protocol, we also build and maintain products and service offerings including <a href=\"%22https:/matcha.xyz/%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matcha</a>, the search engine for tokens, and <a href=\"%22https:/docs.0x.org/0x-api-swap/introduction%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">0x API</a>, the endpoint for multi-chain aggregated liquidity. All of these offerings allow 0x Labs to continue marching towards our vision of building a tokenized world where all value can flow freely at the best prices and with the lowest transaction costs. This way, we can help businesses eliminate the complexity of accessing decentralized markets across all layers of the Web3 exchange stack and have more time to focus on what matters most: their product. </p>\n<p>0x currently supports 8 major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, and Celo, and the 0x ecosystem <a href=\"%22https:/blog.0x.org/0x-ecosystem-update-20/%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">has been rapidly expanding</a>. With integrations across all of the top wallets and apps, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase NFT, Polygon Wallet, Brave, Matcha, dYdX, Zapper, Zerion, and Shapeshift, 0x is fast becoming the trusted standard for all decentralized exchange.</p>\n<p>We’re a remote-first company with core contributors in nearly ten countries and over twice as many cities. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, with an office available for anyone on the team to use at any time. We’ll consider your application regardless of where you call home.</p>\n<p><br><strong>MATCHA</strong><br><br>Matcha is 0x Labs’ first consumer product. It is a meticulously designed decentralized exchange that makes it easy for anyone in the world to access crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain safely. Powered by the 0x API, we provide users with the best prices by aggregating liquidity from all of the major decentralized exchanges and splitting/routing orders intelligently.</p>\n<p>By focusing on user experience and education, Matcha will onboard the next wave of users into the DeFi ecosystem.

We strive to make life better for everyone who touches our product. That means recognizing and honoring the human experience behind sending money. We do that by remaining fee-free in most of our markets and offering round-the-clock customer care.</p>\n<p>Our app is currently available in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and parts of Europe, and sends funds to 19 receiving countries for over 500,000 users.
