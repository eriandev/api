Her name is Alison, she is calling from New York about an issue with her MATCHESFASHION order.

You are polite and proactive; in the end she lowers her guard and opens up. Her order is something she needs for an event that may change her career. Whilst you find out what has happened with her order you realise you share a common interest in art galleries and travel, she suggests her favorite rooftop bar for you to visit if you are ever in New York. In the meantime, you have solved the problem. She is so grateful; you made her day! You wish her luck and close the call.</p>\n<p>And just like that you have shown her that luxury at MATCHESFASHION is more than the content of the parcel she will receive soon <em>(thanks to you!). </em>It is in the expertise, generosity of spirit and in the connection created by its people.</p>\n<p>Since our first MATCHESFASHION shop in Wimbledon over 30 years ago, providing a meaningful and personal luxury experience for our customers has been at the heart of what we do.
