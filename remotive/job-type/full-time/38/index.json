You own the problems and challenges that you see, and proactively work with your colleagues to turn them into opportunities. We're in it together!</li>\n<li style=\"\">Growth mindset. You learn from your mistakes and believe in human potential. It's not that you can't overcome the challenge you're facing, it's just that you haven't overcome it yet. You appreciate the diverse thoughts and perspectives of your colleagues, partners and clients, and you are committed to actively listening and learning.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Getting things done. You are keen to do great work, and ship things often. “Done is better than perfect” might be something you believe in, and while you always strive to deliver what is best for you and your team, you realize that sometimes you'll have to circle back on it to iterate and make improvements.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Flexibility and comfort in ambiguity. You embrace the agile nature of design and development, and you are equally comfortable pivoting your plan and process as you are establishing a workback schedule. Try as we might, things won't always go as planned, and you always try to be ready to deal with that as it comes.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Passion for the problems we're solving. You understand how ecommerce and retail ecosystems are growing with emerging brands and solution providers, and you're keen to make an impact not just on the lives of customers, but on the businesses of our merchant partners and on the environment as well. Together we can save merchants and their customers time and money, AND we can help keep returns out of landfills.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h4\"> </div>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong>OUR COMMITMENTS</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Diversity and inclusion.
