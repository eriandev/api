We help companies get and stay compliant with standards such as ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks rather than months.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Companies nowadays need these standards to win enterprise deals. However, it is a manual, error-prone and tedious process that takes at least 1 year. Our platform integrates with the companies’ tech stack (like GCP, AWS, Azure, Google Workspaces, Jira, Gitlab, etc.), extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain certified. That way we can automate many processes and companies can save 100s of engineering hours working on documentation and excel sheets.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">The fastest company finished their compliance in 4 weeks with us.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Why join Secfix</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In August 2021 we raised a Pre-Seed round from top angel investors (including the first Flixbus investors Heinz Raufer, Rheinhard Wick, and Torsten Sturm) to build our Minimal Certifiable Product (MCP).

These teams should be spending time with people, but unfortunately all facets of People teams are bogged down by managing processes instead of helping people. That’s where Sora comes in: we’re building a product that streamlines the tedious and repetitive work People teams do every day, from sending emails to assigning onboarding tasks to a new hire’s manager to syncing data across anywhere from 3 to 20 tools in a customer’s HR stack.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re a pure startup, with all the excitement that carries as a foundational member, but with more thoughtfulness than the typical early-stage company. We’re committed to our values and we take our mission seriously. Employee experience is in our DNA — we invest in processes that are inclusive and fair, and we invest in our long-term mental, physical, and emotional health.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Sora is committed to being a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, physical disability, or length of time spent unemployed.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>About the Team</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We are a small and mighty team of engineers with a passion for helping People teams do their best work. We’re empathetic, scrappy, nimble, thoughtful and committed to excellence. We listen to our teammates when they raise ideas or concerns. We get to provide input that shapes which features we’ll prioritize as a company, and then we drive the planning, implementation, and release of those features.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We live all over the country and (outside of COVID) love to get together for board games, surfing, cooking, Mario Kart, and more :)</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You're a full-stack engineer with 8+ years of experience in modern web development and cloud technologies, and some experience in DevOps (CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, production support). You’ll be responsible for developing and shipping features and updates to Sora that move us closer to our company mission, bring joy to our customers, keep our product working smoothly for end users, and ensure we're a secure source of employee data for customers.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You’ll build infrastructure in our backend and optimize database queries, add integrations to our 3rd party integrations service (which already has over 1,000 3rd party CRUD methods!), build frontend functionality, and contribute to the foundation of our nascent engineering team. You’ll help us keep our code up-to-date with best practices, and be a champion for shipping well-tested and well-organized code.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You’ll be a driver for positive change to Sora's engineering culture, processes and technology.
