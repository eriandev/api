You don’t feel like working from home today? Come to the office. Fully remote? Sure, not a problem for us, just choose what’s comfortable for you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  As we’re all either IT or data or marketing nerds, we understand that continuous development is part of the job, and we encourage people to learn more and be better. That’s why each month (during working hours) you can spend 16 hours participating in the training you choose (and we’ll even finance it for you – just choose a course that will help you grow in your role).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  We’re also open (like really open!) to new ideas. Do you see a possible improvement to an existing project? Implement it and make your life easier. Do you know software that can make our work more productive? Talk to us about it and we’ll be happy to introduce it for the whole team. We just know that once you’re happy with your job, it’ll also be a pleasure for our clients to work with us.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Job description</strong> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  Laurens Coster has been on the market for 10 years.
