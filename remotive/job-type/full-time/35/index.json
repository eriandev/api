Understanding how a developer's code changes the data, and coming up with new tests, using this knowledge, that may reveal a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Looking at server error logs to determine if a test is failing silently, or creating output in the error log that may reveal a new area that can be tested to identify a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Look at the Javascript browser console to find errors that code may be silently generating, that could reveal a bug or other potential problem.</li> </ul><p><strong>Company Culture</strong></p><p>You'll work with a talented and highly-motivated team that is friendly, fast-moving, self-managing, and highly capable with a sense of humor.
