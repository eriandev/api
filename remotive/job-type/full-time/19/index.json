Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.</p>\n<p>At Metomic, we help tech companies save time &amp; reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio. Our revenue is growing quickly and we’re backed by some great investors like Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc).</p>\n<p><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://workablehr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/photos/332990/2887fc9b0c1e029d8f5469bb5462c3f7.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"h3\"> </div>\n<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>\n<p>Over the past year, our sales team (now 8 strong!) have taken our product to market and have been iterating our value proposition.
