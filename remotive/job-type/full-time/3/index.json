We firmly believe delivering genuine corporate transparency benefits both business and society. Our vision to become the world’s foundational and definitive source of company data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Corporate transparency enables citizens, companies and governments to make clearer choices about who they do business with. It throttles crime, helps protect workers and our environment. It oils the wheels of prosperity, fairness and sustainability.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OpenCorporates was conceived to drive that change. We’ve worked with bodies like <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">the World Bank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.g20.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the G20</a> to spearhead initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://registries.opencorporates.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Company Data Index</a> and the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.gleif.org/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>. Our expertise has shaped how the US Federal Government procures services; we have advised the European Commission on <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/legislation-open-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">the EU Open Data Directive</a>; and we were instrumental in the UK Companies House opening access to their company data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our platform dynamically captures and curates the records of over 200 million companies from 140 jurisdictions around the world — openly available information that is the foundation to sourcing, risk, compliance, and investigations processes for organisations around the world — large and small, public and private.<br><br>To help our rapidly growing user base derive greater insights from our data, we’re solving hard-core ‘big-data’ challenges: modelling, linking, profiling, cleaning and presenting actionable results from billions of data entities. We’re also establishing a globally scalable cloud infrastructure that can run these processes efficiently and reliably at scale; and serve our global audience via an ecosystem to rival AWS for ease of use and integration.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our four company <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/info/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">values</a> outline the shared principles that define our culture and drive our success: we are <strong>bold</strong>, we are <strong>one team</strong>, we <strong>learn &amp; adapt</strong> and we put our <strong>users first</strong>.
