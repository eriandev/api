Your available time for writing code will be reduced. Other tasks, technical or management, will definitely take a higher priority compared to contributing to code.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You like working with people, and balancing their opinions, but can advise others and bring arguments on what you consider the best decisions, coaching, mentoring and supporting colleagues.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You understand the limitations and differences, both technical &amp; political, imposed when dealing with deploying software to customer-facing devices in the real world as opposed to being hidden in the cloud.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Day-to-Day:</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Collaborate with designers and product managers to shape new features and improve existing functionalities</li>\n<li style=\"\">Work closely with other teams within Masabi to transform product requirements into technical solutions</li>\n<li style=\"\">Line management of a team of up to 12 engineers or team leads, working on up to 3 separate delivery streams </li>\n<li style=\"\">Responsible for the full employee life-cycle of direct reports, including interviews, input into the performance review process, and personal and professional development</li>\n<li style=\"\">Delivery management responsibilities, including collaborating with product managers and other team leads to coordinate cross-team activities</li>\n<li style=\"\">Escalation point for field issues, react to production issues, own actions to improve our systems</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What’s in it for you?</strong></p>\n<p>This role is ideal for someone who wants to increase their influence in a delivery team, be a Leader of Leaders, and act as an Engineering Manager.
