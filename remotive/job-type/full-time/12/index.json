We’re looking for go-getters that are excited to thrive in a company going through an exciting growth phase!</p>\n<p>We are a fast-growing SaaS company based in the United States. We are changing the way the world buys enterprise software. We do this by providing intelligent demo automation software that helps you scale Presales. How does this work?</p>\n<p>We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to Presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.</p>\n<p>This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team’s productivity, it also removes the \"demo lag time\" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Our Values: </strong></p>\n<p>Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too.

Everyone here takes total ownership and accountability, because owning our outcomes means making a real contribution. We also believe in a “no peacemongering” principle.

Want to help?</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenCorporates</a> is the largest source of open company data in the world with over 200 million companies in our database. We firmly believe delivering genuine corporate transparency benefits both business and society. Our vision to become the world’s foundational and definitive source of company data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Corporate transparency enables citizens, companies and governments to make clearer choices about who they do business with. It throttles crime, helps protect workers and our environment. It oils the wheels of prosperity, fairness and sustainability.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OpenCorporates was conceived to drive that change. We’ve worked with bodies like <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">the World Bank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.g20.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the G20</a> to spearhead initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://registries.opencorporates.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Company Data Index</a> and the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.gleif.org/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>. Our expertise has shaped how the US Federal Government procures services; we have advised the European Commission on <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/legislation-open-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">the EU Open Data Directive</a>; and we were instrumental in the UK Companies House opening access to their company data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our platform dynamically captures and curates the records of over 200 million companies from 140 jurisdictions around the world — openly available information that is the foundation to sourcing, risk, compliance, and investigations processes for organisations around the world — large and small, public and private.<br><br>To help our rapidly growing user base derive greater insights from our data, we’re solving hard-core ‘big-data’ challenges: modelling, linking, profiling, cleaning and presenting actionable results from billions of data entities. We’re also establishing a globally scalable cloud infrastructure that can run these processes efficiently and reliably at scale; and serve our global audience via an ecosystem to rival AWS for ease of use and integration.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our four company <a href=\"https://opencorporates.com/info/careers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">values</a> outline the shared principles that define our culture and drive our success: we are <strong>bold</strong>, we are <strong>one team</strong>, we <strong>learn &amp; adapt</strong> and we put our <strong>users first</strong>. Whether through day-to-day decision making, teamwork, supporting our clients or evaluating performance, the values are the lens we look through to help us achieve great things.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OpenCorporates operates an informal hybrid model around our London workspace.
