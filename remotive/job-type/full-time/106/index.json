We help companies get and stay compliant with standards such as ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks rather than months.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Companies nowadays need these standards to win enterprise deals. However, it is a manual, error-prone and tedious process that takes at least 1 year. Our platform integrates with the companies’ tech stack (like GCP, AWS, Azure, Google Workspaces, Jira, Gitlab, etc.), extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain certified. That way we can automate many processes and companies can save 100s of engineering hours working on documentation and excel sheets.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">The fastest company finished their compliance in 4 weeks with us.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Why join Secfix</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In August 2021 we raised a Pre-Seed round from top angel investors (including the first Flixbus investors Heinz Raufer, Rheinhard Wick, and Torsten Sturm) to build our Minimal Certifiable Product (MCP). We launched MCP in Nov 2021 with a few startups and scale-ups as early customers. The product pull was so strong that we got to the first 10 customers just within the first weeks. Now Secfix operates in Germany, Austria, Portugal, Spain, UK, and Poland and is a trusted partner of major audit firms (certification bodies).</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’ve recently raised a bigger seed round from leading VCs and investors to expand our product to more security standards, more languages and with the goal to become the category leader in Europe!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">What’s exciting about Secfix is our Company Values:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>We are obsessed with our customers.</strong> We start with the customer and work backward to create products they want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>We build smart.</strong> We love working by YCombinator's principles and we preach those in our team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>We create trust.</strong> Transparency and ethics are within our DNA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>We are hacky.</strong> A functional basic prototype delivered in 2 weeks is worth more than the perfect solution delivered in 2 months.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>We take ownership.</strong> Building a startup is about ownership and being accountable for  timely delivery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>We are leaders of the remote.</strong> We are passionately building a culture where people can be productive working from anywhere.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>About the role:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We're looking for a hungry and hard-working Chief of Staff to help us solve a wide variety of problems across the business and build culture.
