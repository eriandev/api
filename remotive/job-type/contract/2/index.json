So much so that only 10% of qualifying heart patients attend, which results in complications for patients and at least $190B in excess costs. At Carda Health, we have reimagined this care paradigm. Our program allows patients to complete engaging, compassionate, and life-saving therapy from home, virtually.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>\n<p>Carda is a team of clinicians, mathematicians, repeat entrepreneurs, and engineers. And one recovering financier.
