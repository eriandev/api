That being said, we seek to move quickly, we seek to do what’s best for our customers (sometimes without a lot of guidance), and you’ll be more resource-constrained than working at a larger company (e.g., Facebook, Google). In these big tech companies your base compensation might be also a bit higher though your efforts can much more directly impact how valuable the equity upside is here. That environment might be exciting – or it might not align with what you’re looking for.</li>\n<li>You’re uncomfortable with change and ambiguity. Don't take us wrong. It doesn't mean we are changing foundational stuff every second day. No! We are really trying to build a solid foundation and keep building on top of that. We are just saying – if we all do our jobs well, the company will continue to grow rapidly. And that might mean your role will likely shift in scope to accommodate that growth and that new challenges will emerge that we don’t yet have the answers to.
