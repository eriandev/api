It‚Äôs something we filter for in interviews and creates an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones.

We did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don‚Äôt get to practice as engineers, and, at Post, we provide mentorship to improve them and help from the team where you want it.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Put Effort into Diversity¬†</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Diverse teams <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>.
