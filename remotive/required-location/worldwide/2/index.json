We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music and the excitement for innovative technology have proven to make a good combination.</p>\n<p>We say there’s a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately). Our way of being is always sprinkled with <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bmat.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">transparency, perseverance, flexibility, open-mindedness and trustworthiness</a>.</p>\n<p>BMAT has grown as a company of companies. Within BMAT there are a number of products and services that developed semi autonomously for different players – Digital Service Providers, Publishers and Collective Management Organisations.</p>\n<p><em>Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1535670/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1537353,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/product/senior-product-manager-ground-1537353","title":"Senior Product Manager, Ground","company_name":"DroneDeploy","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1537353/logo","category":"Product","tags":["developer","go","marketing","product manager","saas","sales","security","ui","ux","growth","design","Figma","UI/UX","agile","strategy","product strategy","research","sketch","Engineering","packaging","product","customer acquisition","healthcare","information security","data analysis","product owner","computer vision","data","recruiting","creative","web","business","privacy","recruitment","culture","events","development","IT","invision","customer-focused","revenue","travel","construction","software","training"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2023-01-07T13:39:45","candidate_required_location":"Worldwide","salary":"","description":"<div><strong>About DroneDeploy</strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"\">We’re the leading drone software provider making commercial drone data accessible to anyone, anywhere.
