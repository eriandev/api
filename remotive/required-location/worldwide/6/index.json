Mutual respect is at the heart of everything we do on a daily basis. We respect all opinions. We listen. We respect the boundaries of everyone and understand that they are different for everyone. We are inclusive in everything we do. Not everyone feels the same way about speaking up in a meeting. We respect that and find ways to include everybody to not lose a single drop of wisdom. We respect people having different hours where they are most productive. We help each other out even if something is not going according to plan. We understand that this trust and respect will always be mutual.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Open-Source &amp; Transparency</strong></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company’s engineering culture has grown from years of open-source culture. Openness and transparency are central to the success of our engineering team.

A lot is going on. Almost everything we do is highly visible by the public. Everything is fast moving and the next big success and big impact moment is always just a sprint away. That can be incredibly exciting and rewarding for you individually and for the entire team. At the same time, it is also demanding and it will draw energy. Cherish the rewarding moments, fight hard for them but also take time to recharge and balance your life. There is no single recipe for great balance, you have to find and maintain it individually. We are here to support each other in that personal balance.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Personal Growth</strong></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What growth means exactly will be different for all of us. It may involve growing your technical skills, achieving projects to inspire others or get recognized in the broader open-source community, growing your non-technical skills, working more with other peers and achieving more as a team, leveling-up your compensation, or achieving the ideal work - life balance you always wanted.
