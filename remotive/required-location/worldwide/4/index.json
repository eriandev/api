Message queuing with <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> allows transferring data between services and applications in the most effective way. To improve application performance, we implement caching using <strong>Redis</strong>. Our main front-end framework is react.js. To balance the load across multiple site instances, we use <strong>NGINX</strong>. In a bundle with Consul, NGINX balances the traffic among several microservices instances according to setup configurations. <br><br>Massive volumes of data are stored in numerous <strong>MSSQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> relational databases. Since our website is a search engine, we use <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> to access data quickly. Along with Elasticsearch, we use other instruments of Elastic Stack. For example, Logstash and Kibana allow keeping an eye on error logs of our software. <br><br>Together with DevOps, our Developers implement the best CI/CD practices using <strong>GitLab</strong> and <strong>Jenkins</strong>. Using <strong>Prometheus</strong>, we gather performance metrics of our services and applications and then visualize them on <strong>Grafana</strong> dashboards.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Development culture at Jooble</strong></div>\n<p>At Jooble, we strive to create high-quality code. Therefore, we follow coding standards agreed within the development team and conduct timely and effective <strong>code reviews</strong>. To ensure that our software meets business requirements, we apply <strong>TDD</strong>, <strong>DDD</strong>, and <strong>BDD</strong> techniques. Also, our developers often take part in pair/mob programming sessions to brainstorm ideas, design the best solutions, and share expertise within the team.<br><br>We regularly conduct Tech talks where we share knowledge on implementing new development approaches and solving challenging engineering issues. And on <strong>Product Sprint Demos</strong>, we sync on the overall progress of the whole product. We carefully track the progress on tasks in <strong>Jira</strong>, which provides clarity and transparency of the development process.

We’re a mission-driven and diverse team composed of world class talent from Coinbase, Google, Meta, Bitso, Citi, Spotify and other top companies. We are a remote-first and fully distributed company, with team members located across all of the continents besides Antarctica. As early pioneers in the space, we’ve made significant technical contributions to various Ethereum standards over the years; <em>fun fact - our team helped establish the NFT token standard (ERC721).</em></p>\n<p>In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2017, 0x Labs created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: the open-source, global backbone for decentralized exchange. Alongside the core protocol, we also build and maintain products and service offerings including <a href=\"%22https:/matcha.xyz/%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matcha</a>, the search engine for tokens, and <a href=\"%22https:/docs.0x.org/0x-api-swap/introduction%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">0x API</a>, the endpoint for multi-chain aggregated liquidity. All of these offerings allow 0x Labs to continue marching towards our vision of building a tokenized world where all value can flow freely at the best prices and with the lowest transaction costs. This way, we can help businesses eliminate the complexity of accessing decentralized markets across all layers of the Web3 exchange stack and have more time to focus on what matters most: their product. </p>\n<p>0x currently supports 8 major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, and Celo, and the 0x ecosystem <a href=\"%22https:/blog.0x.org/0x-ecosystem-update-20/%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">has been rapidly expanding</a>. With integrations across all of the top wallets and apps, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase NFT, Polygon Wallet, Brave, Matcha, dYdX, Zapper, Zerion, and Shapeshift, 0x is fast becoming the trusted standard for all decentralized exchange.</p>\n<p>We’re a remote-first company with core contributors in nearly ten countries and over twice as many cities. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, with an office available for anyone on the team to use at any time. We’ll consider your application regardless of where you call home.</p>\n<p><br><strong>MATCHA</strong><br><br>Matcha is 0x Labs’ first consumer product.
