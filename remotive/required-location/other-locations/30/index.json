The solution ensures users log in from authorized devices, and that the device meets the security policy requirements during login and continuously after that. Our revolutionary approach empowers zero trust by cryptographically binding the user’s identity to their device and analyzing hundreds of risk signals on an ongoing basis. The company’s advanced risk policy engine enables organizations to implement foundationally secure authentication and utilize risk signals for protection, rather than just for detection and response.

We use real-time communication with great care, and only where it makes sense. We use Whimsical, email, Slack, and Zoom for our day-to-day communication.</p>\n<p>But we also believe in spending quality time together, which is why we try to bring everyone from around the world together at least twice a year for what we call \"Whimsical Summits\". At Summits we focus on getting to know each other better and building bonds that help us communicate better when we're apart.</p>\n<p><em><strong>About Whimsical</strong></em></p>\n<p>Whimsical was founded in 2017 by Kaspars Dancis and Steve Schoeffel to help people think and collaborate in the digital-first work environment.</p>\n<p>We are a remote-first company and big proponents of remote work because it democratizes the opportunities for people everywhere.</p>\n<p>Our operating philosophy is based on set of core principles, such as:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We don't believe in growth at all costs. Growth is a fundamental part of a healthy existence but we want it to be in balance with sustainability and bounded by ethical behavior. We strive to work calm, 40-hour work weeks. Whimsical is also committed to doing our part towards a <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://whimsical.com/blog/on-the-path-to-sustainability\" rel=\"nofollow\">sustainable future for the planet</a>.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> We care deeply about our work. We are specialists, eager learners, and persistent in our pursuit of quality work. We're patient and committed because building great things takes time.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Long-term focus:</strong> We're building Whimsical for the long-haul, not a quick exit. We avoid shortcuts and consider every key decision from a 10+ year perspective.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Partnership Mindset:</strong> We’ve built the company around the idea that everybody who joins us should feel like they are partners in the business. Time is precious and we want Whimsical to be the place where people invest their time rather than sell it. Our equity offers are 100% transparent and above market average. We also pay everyone at the same level the same salary, no matter where they live.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>All information collected through this application is stored in Workable, Whimsical's Applicant Tracking System, where it will be used for internal recruitment purposes only.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1535942/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"}]}
