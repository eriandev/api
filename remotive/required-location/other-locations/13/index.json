To others, tasks you commit to seem like they will take a week, then you pop up in Slack saying \"done, folks\" hours later. You wow the team with most things you do, but sometimes you mess up, and that is ok. You're likely someone who has had some experience building a marketplace, being a leader, being a life-long learner and you have experienced first-hand, the highs and lows of rapid growth.</p>\n<p><strong> To be overly transparent on this one, we really need people who have done a similar role before, at scale, in tech, and preferably globally.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You're a role model and you lead with pride</p>\n<p>You are comfortable and skilled at leading to ensure everyone is engaged, effective, and growing.

If something takes your teammate 30 minutes and you 3 minutes, do it for them. And if you know someone is nervous about a big preso, volunteer private time so they can practice with you). These random acts of goodness should come naturally to you, without overt thought or thinking of \"wow I really went out of my way\". It's just how you are wired.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You're practical &amp; anchored</p>\n<p>You are likely a COO type or not far off, but actually - you have decided you miss getting your hands dirty and you want to scale again with a company FULL of energy, vision, and mission.

Our engineers often go surfing at lunchtime for a few hours.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>‍♂ Training</p>\n<p>Your colleagues are a few of the best people on the planet to drive you towards being the best you. (Sound lame but it's true). Apart from that, you will have access to a number of our advisors, world-class investor networks and the company will support you in finding the best operational mentor that we can.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Transparent and inclusive</p>\n<p>Work in an environment with high trust, transparency, and autonomy</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>❤ Community</p>\n<p>Access to the Lived investor community through Antler Global, Airtree, and Folklore which includes invitations to networking events, industry dinners, Slack groups and more</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Compensation<br><br>Get paid for doing something that you love, that's also changing the world for the better<br>Company stock<br>WFH budget</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Growth opportunities<br><br>You're joining at a great time and if you can keep up, you will have the opportunity to grow at the same rate as the company. We will do everything humanly possible in supporting you to get there.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>World-class science &amp; tech<br><br>Lived has its own network of researchers and engineers, which means the possibilities to innovate, experiment and build are endless! </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">‍‍‍ Our team</div>\n<p>We are a global, distributed team across Australia and North America (and growing!).</p>\n<p>Our team and all of our Guides are made up of people who have lived experience with addiction. People who are living examples of what's possible. People who actually know what it takes.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Our values</div>\n<p>Values are actions not just ideas. They inform the way we treat each other and those we support, as well as the products and experiences we build. With a shared understanding of our values, we can go further together.</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>People are the priority. Period.</p>\n<p>Lived is built by and for real people. From the goals we set to the way we hire; the products we build, to the way we speak—people are always the priority. We hire extraordinary humans and look way beyond just their capabilities. Our team don't miss doctor's appointments or our friend's birthdays—because we're people first and employees second. We're building products to drive better human connection and inclusion. We support 'people living with addiction' and <em>never</em> 'addicts'. We thrive on this connection to ourselves, our peers, our community and our cause.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Clear is kind</p>\n<p>We are highly transparent and embrace vulnerability—and see the extraordinary power in both of those things. We value inclusivity, direct communication, candid feedback and high respect for one another. Our circle of trust enables us to work better, smarter and faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Lead with pride</p>\n<p>Shame and stigma have no place in addiction—or at Lived. We couldn't be more proud of the people and community we support, and we sing it loud and proud. Our bold mission is matched by our determination. We stick to our word and will always do what's right over what's easy. We don't shy away from tough conversations, but we always consider who may be listening.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Listen carefully</p>\n<p>We never have all of the answers. We never assume. We seek to understand. The conversation around addiction and how we best support people will be constantly evolving—and we'll always be listening, and pushing ourselves to learn and grow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>‍♂ </strong>The process we run (so we BOTH know what good likes like)</div>\n<p> </p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Hit apply and follow the prompts If your CV is longer than 2 pages long, try again)</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>A short recorded video interview for us to get to know you better!</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>First interview: You interview the Founder — 40 minutes</p>\n<p>Yup, your opportunity to ask our CEO anything you like, after all this is also about us convincing you to work with us. (not that you will need too much! )</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Second interview: Founder and another Leader will interview you 30-60 mins</p>\n<p>We will go DEEP on your craft in this one, you will have fun. This will either be with our Head Coach, Head of Product or Head of Marketing but don't worry you will meet them all later in the process. Great leaders want to work with other great leaders.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Case study — You present back to the entire team.</p>\n<p>This is your chance to convince the wider team, we are still a small team and we are all about inclusion and involving everyone in the process. This is actually less about the case study and more about your insight, how you communicate, and for us to see how your brain will work. The expectation is you spend no more than an hour or two on this. Likely an interesting operational challenge.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Lunch with the team.</p>\n<p>In person If you're a Sydney sider, if not - we can jump on a zoom call.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Final culture interview — With someone outside of the business, we trust.</p>\n<p>You will get to meet one of our investors. Depending on who you are will depend on who this might be, they are all incredible operators so this will also be a TREAT.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Offer.</p>\n<p>This won't be a shock, we will talk to you about what an offer might look like towards the end of the process and give you the chance to tell us what is important to you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are incredibly excited by you as a future teammate we will fast track this process. If at any stage we decide that there's not a fit we will let you know straight away.</p>\n<p><strong>Last but not least: Addiction is a problem that touches every part of society — no matter what gender, racial background, sexual orientation, or religious belief. That's why we are building a team that is just as diverse as the people affected by addiction.</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1547477/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"}]}
