It throttles crime, helps protect workers and our environment. It oils the wheels of prosperity, fairness and sustainability.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OpenCorporates was conceived to drive that change. We’ve worked with bodies like <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">the World Bank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.g20.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the G20</a> to spearhead initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://registries.opencorporates.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Company Data Index</a> and the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.gleif.org/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>.
