In joining us, you’d bring that same level of world-class support to our customers based in Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In this role, you will spend a lot of time working directly with customers. You’ll also spend time on projects that make the work that we do better. Past projects our team has taken on include:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Curating customer feedback into a weekly digest distributed to the entire company</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Writing and improving help documentation</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Automating tasks to save the team time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">As a company, we value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication.
