SparkPlug allows brands to directly reward these key influencers for every sale they generate with cash via gamified commissions, contests, and goals. We drive more revenue for brands, improve employee performance for retailers, and empower frontline workers across the world with fair compensation and economic equality, all based on the sales revenue they generate each day.</p><p>We’re a San Francisco, CA-based company hiring for a ground-floor product manager to help us enter the hyper-growth phase.
