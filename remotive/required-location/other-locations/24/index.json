Our interview process is three rounds:</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">45-minute introduction call</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A take-home assignment where you will document a QA workflow (4 hours max)</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A meeting with a cofounder (30 minutes)</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">A virtual on-site of 2 hours and 30 minutes (can be split across two days)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews.
