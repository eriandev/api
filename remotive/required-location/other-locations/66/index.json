Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.</p>\n<p>At Metomic, we help tech companies save time &amp; reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio. Our revenue is growing quickly and we’re backed by some great investors like Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc).</p>\n<p><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://workablehr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/photos/332990/2887fc9b0c1e029d8f5469bb5462c3f7.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"h3\"> </div>\n<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>\n<p>Over the past year, our sales team (now 8 strong!) have taken our product to market and have been iterating our value proposition. We count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Jumio, Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent and TravelPerk. We’re entering a really exciting period in our growth journey and are looking to welcome a new Account Executive to the team to be part of this.</p>\n<p>You will be responsible for building relationships with executives and decision-makers (usually CTOs, CIOs and CISOs), gaining a strong understanding of their business needs and priorities, and owning the sales delivery cycle from qualified lead through to onboarding transition with our Customer Success team.</p>\n<p>We’ve set ambitious targets as a business and you will have ownership of a personal target each quarter. We’ve invested, and continue to invest, in the best tools on the market for our sales team so you can focus on what matters most.</p>\n<p>We take learning and career development seriously and want Metomic to be an environment where you can grow and develop your skills down whatever path you’re most interested in. Some of our sales team have moved into more specialised roles, been promoted to new roles, or taken on people leadership responsibilities.

First Hello</strong></p><p>You'll talk to Louisa, one of our early Support team members.</p><p>First, we want to figure out if you've got the right experience for this position and working at Ness is a fit for you and us. We'll have reviewed your application and resume in detail, so this discussion will be mostly a \"behavioral\" interview focused on what you've done before. We want to build conviction you'll succeed in this job the same way you've succeeded in the past.</p><p>Then, you'll have time to ask us anything! (Well, mostly anything.)</p><p><strong>2. Take-Home</strong></p><p>After this, we'll send you a take-home project, similar to what would be expected of you at Ness, to get a sense of how you think and communicate!</p><p>Why? Well, we believe one of the best ways to evaluate your fit for the role is to give you a practical assessment that comes close to what you would be expected to do day-to-day. We'll share more details about this when we get there!</p><p>You'll have 3 days to complete the take-home (~1.5-2 hours of work) and send it back to us, and then we'll take the opportunity to review it.</p><p><strong>3. Meet the Manager</strong></p><p>You’ll have a 30-minute video call with the manager for this role. We’ll have reviewed your take-home project and will ask you some questions about it. We’ll also dig deeper into your past experience. Our goal is to assess if you’re the right fit for the role.</p><p>You’ll also have plenty of time to ask us any questions you have. We want you to feel completely comfortable with the expectations and environment for this role at Ness!</p><p><strong>4. Meet the Team</strong></p><p>You'll talk to another one of our team members for 30 minutes and our CEO &amp; Founder, <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/derekflanzraich/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Derek</a>, on a 30-minute video call.</p><p>Here, we want to explore if we're a good fit for each other. We will have reviewed your application, take-home, and any prior meeting notes in detail, so the discussion will be focused mostly on what brings out the best in you and what's next. We want to be confident Ness can offer the environment (culture, responsibility, org structure, etc...) that's led you to the most professional success so far.</p><p>You'll have time to ask questions, too!</p><p><strong>5. References</strong></p><p>Oh—and, with your help, we'll reach out to folks you've worked with in the past. We're usually pretty far along here, so this is mostly about learning from outside perspectives about how to manage and empower you best.</p><p>If relevant, we might have you also meet some other folks on the team. This can be a great opportunity to get a better feel for us and for us to get a better feel for you!</p><p><strong>6. The Job Offer</strong></p><p>Got this far? That means you're in.
