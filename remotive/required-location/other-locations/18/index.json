These teams should be spending time with people, but unfortunately all facets of People teams are bogged down by managing processes instead of helping people. That’s where Sora comes in: we’re building a product that streamlines the tedious and repetitive work People teams do every day, from sending emails to assigning onboarding tasks to a new hire’s manager to syncing data across anywhere from 3 to 20 tools in a customer’s HR stack.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re a pure startup, with all the excitement that carries as a foundational member, but with more thoughtfulness than the typical early-stage company. We’re committed to our values and we take our mission seriously. Employee experience is in our DNA — we invest in processes that are inclusive and fair, and we invest in our long-term mental, physical, and emotional health.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Sora was founded in late 2018 and launched in 2020. We’ve fundraised from some of the best investors in the world and prioritize keeping a diverse group of investors and advisors.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Sora is committed to being a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, physical disability, or length of time spent unemployed.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>About the team</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our Sales team is full of good listeners and problem solvers. We’re lucky to work with and sell to empathetic, thoughtful people that are bought into our mission and committed to making a difference for employees at their companies. We sell by building relationships with great people and being genuine about how we can solve real problems for them.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We get to work closely with every single team at Sora to inform our product roadmap, ensure a smooth transition from sales to customer onboarding, help marketing with messaging that resonates with customers, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We live all over the country and (outside of COVID) love to get together for board games, surfing, cooking, Mario Kart, and more :)</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>About the role</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Sora has lots of early signs of product/market fit (e.g., we have amazing logos that rave about us and have produced some great case studies), and we have a huge opportunity to solidify our place in the HR tech market and grow exponentially from here.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To do this, you’ll work with our CEO (our Head of Sales) to own the entire sales funnel, working to meet our goals by optimizing and finding repeatability in all parts of the sales process. You’ll create and iterate on a sales process that is consistent and scalable, from prospecting to closing. You’ll manage our existing team of two BDRs, one AE, and one Sales Engineer — coaching and motivating them to success. You’ll own sales forecasting, and ensure that the Sales team and the rest of the organization has access to our Sales metrics (defined and monitored by you) and understands how we’re tracking toward our goals. And as we’re ready to scale, you’ll get to recruit and ramp a team full of empathetic, relationship-building, passionate salespeople.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You’ll learn the ins and outs of our product and speak to customers so you can keep a pulse on our process and suggest improvements.
