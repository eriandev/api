We all hate packing, printing, and shipping unwanted items only to wait weeks for a refund … And retailers have it rough too.

Nobody wins.</p>\n<p>This is why ReturnBear exists. We are Canada's first end-to-end reverse logistics solution. Our nationwide drop-off network means immediate exchanges and returns with no re-packing. We sort and QA goods to get inventory back to merchants fast, giving retailers 20%+ savings and making consumers happier.
