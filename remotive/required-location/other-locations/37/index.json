We’ll be happy to check out your portfolio and get back to you!</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Who We Are</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, a bit about us. STRV is a software design and engineering team that delivers next-level products. Here since 2004, we’ve delivered solutions for partners ranging from startups to enterprises, including Barry’s, Microsoft, MedMen, Barnes &amp; Noble, The Athletic, Autodesk, and more.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We focus on mobile applications, websites, backend infrastructure, IoT, blockchain, and data science/ML/AI. We have a footprint in specialized domains like dating, crypto, and mobile gaming. On top of that, we’ve also got some successful internal spin-off projects (like Surge and Zoe), with more in the works — including a space western multiplayer NFT game. Feel free to ask us all about them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The culture is very open and friendly, with everyone on the team self-driven in delivering the highest possible value for clients — because we all care about building partnerships and creating products that make us proud. But you’ve probably scrolled our web and read about all that already. </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">How You Fit In</div>\n<p>You’ll be joining our Design team and will be working on projects that usually last around 3 months and can involve design, development, QA, and product management. Usually, you can expect to work on only one project at a time and be involved from start to finish.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">International Community</div>\n<p>A few things to know: STRV people represent about 26 nationalities, so our official language is English. For people that decide to relocate to the Czech Republic, we’re always happy to provide visa sponsorships and relocation support. And as for meeting our US clients, there may be times you’ll get to visit them — or you may see them strolling through our Prague office since they’re often curious to see the STRV in action and to meet their team in person.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Learning &amp; Other Opportunities</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With over 9 designers, a team lead and a creative director, there’s always someone to consult, have a design feedback session with and learn from. We also host a couple of meetups and workshops, and our designers have a generous conference budget. The occasional trip to conferences worldwide is absolutely on the table.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, in line with our knowledge-sharing mindset, we are all working in Figma, where you can see what everybody is working on in real-time.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">At STRV, Your Role Will Be To</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Confidently describe your design solutions to our clients at all levels</li>\n<li style=\"\">Be responsible for the whole design output on a given project</li>\n<li style=\"\">Collaborate with other designers on projects</li>\n<li style=\"\">Perform as a fearless team player, as you’ll also be collaborating with other departments and supporting them until the project is fully finished</li>\n<li style=\"\">Provide constructive feedback to other designers to help them move forward</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">We Expect You To Have</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">A user-centered product design approach</li>\n<li style=\"\">A natural drive that will fit in with our always curious, tight-knit team; open, honest communication, and the ability to learn are a must</li>\n<li style=\"\">Multiple years of experience in the industry and a mind full of ideas ready to be put into action</li>\n<li style=\"\">The ability to start a project with user flows and wireframes, visually perfecting its UI and finishing it by prototyping and presenting to a client independently</li>\n<li style=\"\">Experience with Figma</li>\n<li style=\"\">Confident English on a high level; due to our primarily US-based clientele, our designers present and consult their work in English</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">Perks &amp; Benefits</div>\n<p><strong>We want you to feel at home.
