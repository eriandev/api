Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.</p>\n<p>At Metomic, we help tech companies save time &amp; reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio. Our revenue is growing quickly and we’re backed by some great investors like Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc).</p>\n<p><img height=\"427\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RKg3QNZ7xaIx9KOdFS4o9XuTb-wftSRGu-e_zB1H-W70Zo6_8AcivkJh3vbVDi2lIUoBRAucVSRG_hmPQh5LkD4f6kjO-NI8NmDTwWRpFhctHhRTGBmvGnW-KlftRYZxun6U6bVd8XJobtCgSg\" width=\"624\"></p>\n<div class=\"h3\"> </div>\n<p><strong>Engineering Team</strong></p>\n<p>As we continue to change the way companies deal with their sensitive data, our Engineering Team (currently 8 strong) is growing and we’re looking to welcome Software Engineers, either back-end or full-stack, to our team to be part of this journey.</p>\n<p>Some of the areas you may be working on: Our sensitive data and classification engine, building systems to allow us to process billions of messages a day, data ingest pipelines, sensitive data remediation system, risk identification and ranking engines and alerting systems.</p>\n<p>Our back-end services are written in Typescript and make extensive use of Kafka, GraphQL and Postgres. Our front-end is written in React/TypeScript. Our house style is grounded in functional programming principles. We use AWS ECS Fargate via github actions and Terraform to deploy to production multiple times a day.</p>\n<p><strong>What you'll be doing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Scaling Engineering</em> - You will scale our Engineering function, providing technical, people and process leadership as we embark on a hyper-growth journey.</li>\n<li><em>People Leadership</em> - Hire, onboard, develop, coach and motivate a team of Engineers.

We're on the hunt for someone who can write engaging and persuasive copy for our landing pages, emails, social media ads, banners, etc.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>What you'll need to do</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate copy for all marketing projects: Black Friday, webinars and any other special promotion projects. For example, for our recurring webinars you'll need to create the following types of copy: landing page, email sequence, ad copy for Facebook and Instagram, chatbot notifications, sms notifications etc.</li>\n<li>Create copy for the website. For example, copy for About Us page or a new product feature. </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Why it's great to work with us</strong></div>\n<p>Selzy does more than just emails — we are developing a whole marketing automation platform with a startup's persistence and love for our users and desire to create wow functionality. </p>\n<p>Here's why you'll love working with us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can work remotely in an international team of 80+ people (from Cyprus, Ukraine, Thailand, etc)</strong>. We all work remotely and believe in teamwork, collaboration and diversity. </li>\n<li><strong>You'll get to try lots of different formats.</strong> We're experimenting a lot. This means, you will produce copy for such off-the-beaten-path projects like “The Big Marketing Wall of Hate”, “Twitter Advent Calendar”, etc. And you'll get to let your creativity run really wild for the social media ad copy ;) </li>\n<li><strong>We are always ready to help and brainstorm together if something doesn't work out.</strong> We have regular brainstorm sessions, 1-2-1 meetings, and we're always up for a quick call if you need it.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong><br>You are a great fit if:</strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You have experience</strong> <strong>producing neat marketing copy in American English</strong> for landing pages, ads, newsletters, banners, etc. Your written English is excellent (close to native) and you can prove it with your portfolio. </li>\n<li><strong>You produce your copy with the business needs in mind</strong>: you know by experience which tricks to use to make that copy generate as many clicks/sign-ups/comments as it can.</li>\n<li><strong>You're ready to own up to the result of your work.</strong> We're here to help you out any moment but we expect you to take full responsibility for the copy you create. </li>\n<li><strong>You're ready to dig deep to find the right info for your copy for any project.</strong> It often takes setting up calls and asking lots of questions to the project owner before you can get to writing.</li>\n<li><strong>You're a true marketing junkie. </strong>You're probably subscribed to dozens of newsletters, enjoy quirky creative ads you come across on Facebook, and have seen a gazillion landing pages so you can tell a good one from a boring one.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1513866/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"}]}
