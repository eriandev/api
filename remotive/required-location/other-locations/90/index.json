When the CEO is kept out of operations, yet still has a pulse on each team and scoreboard and can spend his time being creative within the company, you will know you are successful. You should have a go-getter attitude, experience in an Executive Assistant position, and possess a versatile skillset to ensure the company’s workflow runs smoothly.
