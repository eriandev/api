We believe the world will be a better place if every citizen has access to information to make informed decisions about their vote in every election in which they are eligible to vote: primary, general, and special elections; federal, state, and local offices.</p>\n<p>We work diligently to present the available information about elections, candidates, judges, ballot measures, policies, and more in a way that enables our readers to vote with confidence and to act as engaged citizens outside of the polling booth.</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia readers, like Ballotpedia staff, are special people.</p>\n<p>When we launched in 2007, we did not go out of our way to seek new readers. Starting with our small team of visionary idealists, nerds, and aspiring political journalists, we just wrote the best unbiased online articles we could, especially about ballot measures. Readers found those articles in droves. It turns out there was an unclaimed audience out there‚Äîpeople who wanted straightforward facts about political issues, and were willing to read at length instead of just scanning the headlines.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf you build it, they will come:'' our readers came to our neutral oasis in growing numbers; we‚Äôve had many millions of lifetime pageviews, we reached nearly half of all voters in 2020, and, in the month surrounding the November 2020 election, we were the 77th most-visited website in the U.S.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôve come to realize that we need to meet our readers where they are. In doing so, over the past five years, we‚Äôve grown our email newsletter program from infancy to include more than 1,000,000 opt-in subscribers with more than a dozen newsletters to choose from. We are working in numerous ways to help put our neutral information in front of people at the times when they most need it, including on mobile phones while you‚Äôre standing in the voting booth. We firmly believe that our readers, and the mindset we help them cultivate, are essential in a world where too many others are fighting to get us all addicted to sensational posts and the irrational decisions they foster.</p>\n<p>If this is a mission you‚Äôd be willing to work hard to achieve, and if this is a team you‚Äôd be willing to work hard with‚ÄîJOIN US.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1503053/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"}]}
