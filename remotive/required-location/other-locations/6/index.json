We think there’s a better alternative to brand new – our purpose is to champion vintage for a more characterful and sustainable world.</p>\n<p>Vinterior launched in 2016 with 12 London dealers and 200 mid-century furniture pieces. In five years, we’ve grown to 1,800 vintage sellers across Europe, listing 200,000+ products across 97 furniture and homeware categories and generating over $600 million in sales worldwide.</p>\n<p>After growing 120% in 2020, we’ve become the leading vintage marketplace in the UK.
