We accomplish far more than what others thought possible. We exhibit unrelenting reliability. When we say something will be done, it will be done. We solve the root problem instead of settling for a quick fix.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><em><strong>Improving Something Every Day</strong>:</em> We dare to question the status quo.

From the moment we break ground on a new project, to the final day we serve a resident, it is the responsibility of EVERY Norhart employee to OBSESS over the experience that resident is going to have with us.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><em>Level Yourself Up: </em>We want to be the best in the world at what we do. We want to be so much better than the competition that the fight isn’t fair. We own our own self-improvement, and we push our mentors to teach us more.
