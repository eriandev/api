We’re now over 160 people, spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Rio de Janeiro, London, Paris, New Jersey, Oslo, LA, Singapore, Tokyo, Manila, Bangkok and Lagos.</p>\n<p>We’re <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bmat.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a team of pretty decent people</a> who enjoy working with each other. We’re open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We’ve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music and the excitement for innovative technology have proven to make a good combination.</p>\n<p>We say there’s a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately). Our way of being is always sprinkled with <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bmat.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">transparency, perseverance, flexibility, open-mindedness and trustworthiness</a>.</p>\n<p>BMAT has grown as a company of companies. Within BMAT there are a number of products and services that developed semi autonomously for different players – Digital Service Providers, Publishers and Collective Management Organisations.</p>\n<p><em>Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1535670/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1537616,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/product/head-of-product-1537616","title":"Head of Product","company_name":"Serotonin","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1537616/logo","category":"Product","tags":["crypto","education","go","legal","marketing","growth","management","content","strategy","research","product management","community","product","market research","communications","business","leadership","metrics","media","fintech","growth marketing","communication","agency"],"job_type":"","publication_date":"2023-01-07T13:39:44","candidate_required_location":"Worldwide","salary":"","description":"<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Head of Product</strong></div>\n<p><strong>Who is Serotonin?</strong></p>\n<p>Serotonin is the leading breakthrough marketing and communications partner for digital asset companies, working with the top businesses and entrepreneurs in the industry on brand positioning, media relations, content, growth marketing, and go-to-market strategy.
