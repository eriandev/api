A·Team matches small teams of the most talented builders in the world with companies backed by a16z, YC, Softbank, General Catalyst, etc. on a contract basis for many of their most important initiatives. We quietly launched in May 2020, and have helped A·Teamers earn $11.4+ million since.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><em>As part of A·Team, you can expect:</em></span></p>\n<ul style=\"padding-inline-start: 48px;\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;\">High-paying, meaningful missions with the most audacious companies</span> sent your way; generally $110-$190/hr, with vetted, fascinating clients doing work that matters. We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 600; color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0.75px;\">Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </span>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals.
