You’ll join a team that is still below 100 people that passionately believes in the power of sharing ownership. This is a fantastic opportunity to really make your mark as we continue to scale up.</p>\n<p>As a legal tech business we support our clients in a number of different areas - not just share schemes, but also helping them through the implications of Shareholder Agreements, Articles of Associations, Investment Agreements, and company equity structures.
