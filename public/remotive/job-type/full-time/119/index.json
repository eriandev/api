We believe that it’s through small actions happening everywhere that culture can shift. Our work focuses on turning the care we have for each other into simple, creative, effective action. Every day, we train hundreds of people to respond to, intervene in, and heal from harassment. We hold space for people experiencing harassment to share their stories for affirmation and support. And we prepare new leaders to create workplaces, schools, and communities around the world that are filled with humanity. So that we can all be who we are, wherever we are.</p><p>Over the past two years, Right To Be has significantly expanded our training program -- particularly in the realm of sexual harassment and bystander intervention training. Our evaluation system shows that it’s working: Right To Be’s training shows an 84% increase in self-reported ability to intervene in instances of hate and harassment. This finding has been echoed by the National Women’s Law Center, which notes that while traditional liability-based training on harassment is failing, innovations in the field, such as bystander training, are seeing results.</p><p>In 2021, Right To Be trained over 250,000 people to intervene in, respond to and prevent harassment. We continue to innovate in the field with new training to support communities experiencing harm, such as bystander intervention to stop islamophobia/anti-semitic hate and harassment. We have established meaningful partnerships with organizations such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC and L’Oreal Paris to bring our methodologies to participants around the globe in over 33 countries and languages.</p><p><br></p>Reporting to the Director of Finance, the full-charge bookkeeper will support the accounts payable, receivable, and bank reconciliation for Right To Be Inc.
