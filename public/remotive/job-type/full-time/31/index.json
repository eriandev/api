We make it possible for anyone to make an impact on the elections that determine the balance of power in our country, by volunteering in and donating to key races. Since launching in 2017, Swing Left volunteers have raised $80 million for Democratic candidates, civic organizations, and voter mobilization efforts, and made more than 44 million combined phone calls, door knocks, and letters sent to voters via our affiliate Vote Forward and their partners.</strong></p> <div class=\"h1\"><strong>About Vote Forward</strong></div> <p><strong>Vote Forward is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization that builds tools to encourage Americans to vote.

Since 2018, more than 250,000 grassroots volunteers have used the Vote Forward platform to send handwritten letters to more than 25 million prospective voters to encourage them to register to vote and turn out for elections.
