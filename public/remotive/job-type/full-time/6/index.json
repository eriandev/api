We think there’s a better alternative to brand new – our purpose is to champion vintage for a more characterful and sustainable world.</p>\n<p>Vinterior launched in 2016 with 12 London dealers and 200 mid-century furniture pieces. In five years, we’ve grown to 1,800 vintage sellers across Europe, listing 200,000+ products across 97 furniture and homeware categories and generating over $600 million in sales worldwide.</p>\n<p>After growing 120% in 2020, we’ve become the leading vintage marketplace in the UK. And we’re not stopping there. We’ve raised a $10m Series A to accelerate growth and expand into new markets, with the mission to become the #1 vintage platform in Europe by love and scale.</p>\n<p><strong>About the Product team:</strong></p>\n<p>Vinterior comprises a team of 43, including 7 in engineering and 5 in Product (3 PMs, 1 Product designer and 1 Product analyst)</p>\n<p>We currently have 2 cross-functional squads, growing into 3 squads, plus a varying number of stakeholders, and we’re looking to hire an experienced Product designer to support 1 or 2 of our squads.

It’s something we filter for in interviews and creates an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are able to focus 36h out of a 40h work week.   </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Increase Leverage not Team Size</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We built Post Media with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales.

At the core of Post is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving.

We did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Post, we provide mentorship to improve them and help from the team where you want it.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Put Effort into Diversity </strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Diverse teams <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>.
