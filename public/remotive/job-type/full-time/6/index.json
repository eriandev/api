We've made a bet that the people building products and companies around Crowdbotics represent a new kind of software creator that, if we do our job right, will become the new normal for how people build software in the next decade — with readymade parts, cloud talent, and automated tools that empower everyone to be a maker. We see this as the future, and our customers, investors, and the market do too.To that end, Crowdbotics is creating what we call an “<strong>Operating</strong><strong> System for Application Development</strong>”.What exactly does this mean?Contemporary application development requires the use of multiple tools and processes that are often spread across multiple disconnected systems.

You'll be building a product that saves lives; multiple Clinical Engineers (ex-MDs and fullstack SWEs) quit lucrative medicine jobs to join Anima for that very reason!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our ambition is to be the OS for all of healthcare and life sciences, through a proprietary active learning, crowdsourcing training architecture - we call it Anima 2.0. We already have one of the biggest, highest quality labelled datasets in the world.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We're profitable, growing at 300-400% MoM, and went from $0 ARR to $1m ARR in 6 months from launch (Apr '22). That's pretty unprecedented in SaaS, never mind healthcare! We have a pretty unique hacker culture at Anima: almost everyone is technical and can code. A 'knights of the round table' structure and thinking from first principles is core to our culture, and is how we've made such rapid progress. It's reflected in how we operate:</p>\n<ol style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">There's no separate product &amp; engineering teams - instead, we have Clinical Engineers who are both their own customers (MDs) and are strong fullstack engs, collaborating with pure software engineers. Due to the quality of our team, there's a heavy focus on coaching and teaching, with minimal to no line management.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We're relentlessly resourceful - in 14 months, we've built an extremely loved enterprise app (NPS = 87) that users have said 'seems too good to be true'. Anima can take an information complete medical history as good or better than a typical human doctor, and automates patient comms and clinical notes.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Anima is a safe haven for free thinkers and we've been careful to build a culture where everyone feels comfortable being their complete self, without ever needing to self-censor. Our hiring acceptance rate is around 0.5-0.8%, which is lower than YC. You're joining hyper elite special forces, and your crewmates will never let you down or waste your time.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We hire candidates from all over the world. We have remote hobs in EU West and NA, and plans to seed some in person teams in those areas too in the next 12 months (in addition to our fully remote teams).</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We have a good time :) we've had team lunches in Duck &amp; Waffle, Breakfast Club, dumplings in Chinatown, had private screenings in our own cinema, booked out the Sky Pool etc. We get the whole team together at least twice a year for team retreats, with the next one planned to be in South Africa.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Anima has a unique hacker culture: everyone is technical with almost complete autonomy</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><em>Everyone</em> is technical at Anima and can write production code. This makes for a truly flat hierarchy. There’s no separate founder, product or customer team. We've been able to make huge strides in the NHS because we all deeply understand the problem, engineering, grading for potential features, and real life clinical trade-offs. This deep domain knowledge is ultimately how we integrated with the major electronic health records (EMIS and SystmOne) in just 4 months.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We only hire exceptional talent who can think from first principles and have high growth potential - great decision makers who deserve to have complete autonomy and are forces of nature when empowered with it. At the same time, we are deeply collaborative, and through mutual and self-challenge, we converge towards the optimum, and decisively execute. We are united by child-like intellectual curiosity and experiment and wander freely when the right path isn’t clear. We believe all future managers should be formidable ICs &amp; domain experts.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Decisions are never made in isolation by the founders. All information is transparently available to the whole team on our Notion - every meeting, decision, success, failure. Anima is a safe refuge for everyone to share their honest thoughts, feelings and be their complete unfiltered self. We offer unlimited holidays and flexibility over work schedule and location.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>The quickest way to get your code into the hands of users.

Now he’s created v2 of the tool, built on top of a proprietary graph database (AnimaDB) because none of the third party services were sufficient for our requirements.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Alex, a clinical engineer, built ‘Slack for medical teams’, supporting 1000s of channels per organisation and a real time single source of truth for patient data, in 4 weeks, picking up a large set of new technologies on the way (ground up built from low-level services like Appsync, GraphQL, VTL, not Twilio). We’ve started using it instead of Slack internally 😃</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Alec, a pure software engineer, built ‘Omnichannel chat’ for patients and their care teams, which unifies all events and messages (patient state changes, SMS, email, in-app) into a single page, in 1.5 weeks.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Does this sound like you?</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Hungry and wants their shot to change the world - a force of nature when empowered with the tools, resources and development to do it.
