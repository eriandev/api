Inspired by the current state of politics, people from every background imaginable have stepped up to run, including our CEO, Brian, who ran for Congress in 2018. Our other two co-founders, Susie and Karan, led the finance and technology arms of his campaign. They learned firsthand the painful process of manually stitching together critical finance and compliance data using outdated campaign software.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staff, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In our first three years, we’ve already helped more than 300 campaigns manage over $1 billion in contributions. The US has more than 500,000 elected officials, and many more candidates run for office at all levels of government.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Who We Are</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our CEO, Brian, was a Senior Tech Advisor in the Obama White House, taught at MIT, and co-founded one of the largest phone companies in Nicaragua. Our CTO, Karan, oversaw the technical infrastructure of 80 campaigns last cycle and is a 3x startup CTO. Our CFO, Susie, was the Corporate VP of Finance &amp; Accounting for AECOM, an 87,000-person company.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We believe our democracy is strongest when it’s represented by the diversity of our country. Similarly, we believe the strength of our company will come from the diversity of our employees – that's why we've worked hard to ensure that our cap table is fully diverse and that half of our angel investors are women. If you share our values and enthusiasm for strengthening our democracy, you’ll feel at home at Numero!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Interested?</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">To apply, submit the application below sharing a bit about why you're excited to work at Numero, your resume, and links to any public online profiles (e.g. Github, LinkedIn, etc) you’d like to share.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If it seems like we might be a good fit, we’ll schedule a quick 30 minute call to chat about your past work and go from there. <strong>Go for it!
