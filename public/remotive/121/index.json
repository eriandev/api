But the payments infrastructure on which it runs is broken. For the hard-working men and women of this sector, the existing suite of payment tools is outdated, difficult to use, prone to fraud, and saddled with shady fee structures. The incumbent players in this space often overlook the economic and practical needs of this user base.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>We're changing that. </strong><a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://atob.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AtoB</a> is building Stripe for Transportation — modernizing the payments infrastructure for trucking and logistics.
