Increased efficiency, enhanced profitability, and second to none customer service for each of our customers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>SHOP-WARE'S STORY</strong></p>\n<p>Shop-Ware was born from a direct need of the end-user -- our Founder and CEO (and respected auto mechanic), Carolyn Coquillette. Carolyn opened Luscious Garage in 2007 to service the then-burgeoning hybrid car market, and through the experience of building out its operations, she discovered the need for better shop management software that more closely aligned with the shop's values of efficiency, transparency, and building customer relationships. Thus, Shop-Ware was born.</p>\n<p>Shop-Ware is now the preferred software for thousands of shops across North and South America, from mom-and-pop SMBs to multi-location businesses.</p>\n<p>We pride ourselves on the way we live our values:</p>\n<p>Innovation, Quality, Compassion, Clarity, and Solutions.</p>\n<p>When you join us, you can expect a high-growth environment, driven coworkers (no pun intended) with a customer-first mentality, and enormous opportunities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>SHOP-WARE'S INVESTORS</strong></p>\n<p>Insight Partners</p>\n<p>Bosch<br></p>\n<p><strong>WHO WE ARE HIRING:</strong></p>\n<p>Shop-Ware is looking for a Director of Finance to support data-driven decision making through strong accounting, cash management and partnering with the leadership team on smart growth initiatives.
