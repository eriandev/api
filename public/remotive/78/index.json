You will utilise your experience to drive a systematic programme of process improvement, from ticket resolution, streamlining support processes and making sure the right team has access to the insights the helpdesk generates to guide product improvements. <br><br>We expect you to act as the escalation point for complex matters as well as offering support and guidance to the team to enable them to deal with such matters, moving forward that are systematic in nature. As the company increases the number of customers we serve, jurisdictions we cover and volume of data we transact, the workload of the Customer Service Desk will also increase, so we would love to find somebody who keeps scalability in mind when proposing solutions. As the workload dictates, you may be required to handle parts of the workload directly. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\">Required Experience:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Experience managing a customer-facing help desk or service desk, ideally in a modern software environment</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An understanding and experience of working within an Agile environment</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Excellent knowledge of ITIL</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Great communication skills (particularly written)</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Experience with a range of service desk software such as Jira Service Desk (ideal), ZenDesk, Freshdesk or similar</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\">Desired Experience:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Exposure of dealing with detailed processes of a compliance/regulated area, such as Data Protection (UK/EU GDPR)</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Startup/scale up experience in a tech/software/online company</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\"><strong>Benefits:</strong></span></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Competitive salary</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Share options scheme</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Flexible hours</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remote-first working</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">28 days holiday plus bank holidays</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Company Bonus</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 day additional holiday each year</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Time off for life events</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">£500 home office budget</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cycle to work scheme</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Quarterly socials</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wellbeing Pledge</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Life assurance</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">£1000 learning and wellness allowance, plus learning days</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\">Diversity Matters:</span></strong></div>\n<p>Don’t meet every single requirement below?
