Our mission is to make art accessible to everyone, by engaging with and innovating within all aspects of its creation and distribution.</p>\n<p>HENI prides itself on a connection with and commitment to cutting-edge technology across all our platforms. This is exemplified by our NFT Studio and marketplace, which have launched several fine art NFTs to date, starting with Damien Hirst’s The Currency. The Currency NFT collection has been very successful, with over $90M+ USD of secondary market trading since 27 July 2021, a significant amount of which has gone through the HENI NFT marketplace.</p>\n<p>But HENI is much more than NFT’s!</p>\n<p>HENI has a history in the physical art world and has developed platforms that focus on trading art, art education, art production, and publishing.</p>\n<p>We also develop apps that use huge quantities of art-related data from across the globe. These apps are both web and mobile and use a variety of machine learning techniques to sort through and make sense of the data. Once launched recently was HENI News, an art news aggregation service.</p>\n<p>Moreover, HENI also has a number of interactive and dynamic customer-facing websites, including e-commerce and streaming services.</p>\n<p>Everything we develop is in-house and we have very strong engineering and data teams to make all this possible.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Technology at HENI</strong></p>\n<p>Our growing technical team contains a set of very capable Engineers, Data Scientists, DevOps, and supporting staff. We constantly tackle new and challenging problems – some of these solutions have involved developing our own in-house tools using machine learning, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality. Utilising modern cloud infrastructure and coding practices, we pride ourselves on exceeding the expectations of internal and external stakeholders. Using the very best tools, frameworks, and programming standards, including TDD, BDD, and Acceptance Criteria Testing, we aim to create a technical team that leads by example and excels in clean, readable, and modular code.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Position overview</strong></p>\n<p>We are looking to recruit a Senior Security Specialist; this specialist will be responsible for the full security spectrum with regard to technology within the business.</p>\n<p>You will be responsible for implementing and maintaining a security policy, managing security risks, researching and being aware of new and old threats on the web (including cloud), Web3, and Blockchain stacks, ensuring user security and education are maintained throughout the HENI user sphere, performing security assessments, white hat attacks, mitigating risks, performing patches, advising on architecture risks, performing security due diligence of suppliers and interconnected businesses.</p>\n<p>This is a stand-alone role within HENI and therefore, you will need to be a self-starter. It involves both policy writing and implementation. The initial task will involve a full assessment of HENI’s cyber and information security capability and produce recommendations on where we can improve.</p>\n<p>Your background</p>\n<p>We are looking for someone who has worked in a small to medium-sized business. Security is very different in a large-scale enterprise, and we want someone who can use their experience to assess threats specific to HENI.</p>\n<p>You must have a background in cloud security, ideally AWS, as you will be working with our DevOps team to ensure our infrastructure is as secure as possible.</p>\n<p>You need to have worked with a modern tech stack as well.
