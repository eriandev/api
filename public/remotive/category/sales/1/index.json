These teams should be spending time with people, but unfortunately all facets of People teams are bogged down by managing processes instead of helping people. That’s where Sora comes in: we’re building a product that streamlines the tedious and repetitive work People teams do every day, from sending emails to assigning onboarding tasks to a new hire’s manager to syncing data across anywhere from 3 to 20 tools in a customer’s HR stack.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re a pure startup, with all the excitement that carries as a foundational member, but with more thoughtfulness than the typical early-stage company. We’re committed to our values and we take our mission seriously. Employee experience is in our DNA — we invest in processes that are inclusive and fair, and we invest in our long-term mental, physical, and emotional health.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Sora was founded in late 2018 and launched in 2020.
