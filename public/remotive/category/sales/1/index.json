Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.</p>\n<p>At Metomic, we help tech companies save time &amp; reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Octopus Energy, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk, Crypto.com and Jumio. Our revenue is growing quickly and we’re backed by some great investors like Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://workablehr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/photos/332990/2887fc9b0c1e029d8f5469bb5462c3f7.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h3\">The Sales Team</div>\n<p>Over the past year, our sales team (now 8 strong!) have taken our product to market and have been iterating our value proposition.

We’re entering a really exciting period in our growth journey and are looking to welcome a new Account Executive to the team to be part of this.</p>\n<p>You will be responsible for building relationships with executives and decision-makers (usually CTOs, CIOs and CISOs), gaining a strong understanding of their business needs and ways of working, and developing a pipeline of qualified opportunities in partnership with our Account Executives and Senior Account Executives.
