With early student assessment, intervention and accommodation and professional development for educators, Learning Ally can identify and prevent learning issues by working with schools and educators to support new and struggling readers. Our solutions build a strong foundation for independent, engaged learners who are empowered to achieve socially, emotionally, and academically, regardless of background or learning difference.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1948 as Recording for the Blind, to help soldiers who lost their sight in combat continue their education with audiobook products, Learning Ally has evolved to help individuals understand the unique ways they learn and match them to the solutions that enable personal achievement. </p>\n<p>Today, Learning Ally reaches over 1,600,000 students, 260,000 educators and 21,600 schools across the country and continues to expand its reach.

We believe in building amazing marketing tools, delivering transformational programs, working on fun projects and….actually making great money while living balanced, inspiring lives.<br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Why?</div>\n<p>100 million people in the United States are doing work they are disengaged with. All of those people have kids, nieces, and nephews who are watching them. And most of them will grow up to do the same thing: dreading every Monday, following the same routine, and showing up each morning to do work they don't love.<br><br></p>\n<p>The problem with that is: Many of those kids are destined to grow up and become great leaders that solve great problems like curing cancer, fixing global warming, and making the world a better place to live. But they won't. Instead, they'll become accountants because that's what dad did.<br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">What if that was different?</div>\n<p>Instead of growing up watching the adults they look up to doing stuff they hate, what if they saw that there was a different way to do things? What if they saw them becoming programmers, writers, inventors, taking their ideas and turning them into things that help people? What if they saw the adults in their lives excited, engaged, living fully alive? What gigantic problems could we solve then? How much better would your life and my life be?<br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">This is why Growth Tools exists.</div>\n<p>We’re on a mission to make it nearly impossible for our clients to fail at getting more customers. Specifically, we have a goal to add $100m in revenue to our clients businesses. And we track it weekly.</p>\n<p>We achieve this goal, by providing our clients with access to a world class program powered by real human coaches, the top industry playbooks, and an industry-leading software system.<br><br></p>\n<p>Our mission is impossible without you. Right now, the interest for our program is so heavy, we can’t enroll clients fast enough! In fact, in the last two months, we have missed more than 100 pre-booked calls with business owners desperate to learn about the program!</p>\n<p>This role is our #1 priority for our company right now!</p>\n<p>That is because every client starts their relationship with Growth Tools through a personalized 1:1 enrollment call and sales process. In the last few months, our sales team has risen to new heights and set back-to-back sales records for the company (and still missing calls!).</p>\n<p>Clearly, we need to add another World-Class Sales Advisor to our team - yesterday! Without you, we cannot get our system into the hands of more business owners fast enough!<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>What does Growth Tools do and why?</strong></p>\n<p>Growth Tools provides the tools and training to help online businesses double their revenue in 1 year. Our tools consist of 10 SaaS products that we give away for free and our private coaching program, Growth University.</p>\n<p>We provide each client with a custom marketing roadmap so they know the exact steps to take to grow their revenue and achieve their goals. We’ve built a proprietary system that allows us to track each client's progress daily and know exactly when they need help, a second set of eyes, or human accountability.</p>\n<p>We believe that the world is a better place when people create and those creations are shared.</p>\n<p>Example: I looooove Allbird shoes.</p>\n<p><em>Guess how Allbirds came to exist? A random dude, Tim Brown, had the idea for them. And he had enough gumption and know-how to go out and actually make them. Now, Allbirds is one of the most successful upstart shoe brands from the past 5 years.</em></p>\n<p>The world is a better place when every Tim out there turns their ideas into real-life products.</p>\n<p>That’s why our goal is to generate $100 million in revenue for our clients. That is our measurement to know these creations are being shared and real value is being generated as a result.</p>\n<p>If the idea of talking with CMOs, Founders, Influencers and aspiring Entrepreneurs with some of the most impactful and fun companies in the world sounds exciting...<em>keep reading</em><em>.<br><br></em></p>\n<p><strong>In this role, you will learn:</strong></p>\n<p>1. How to effectively qualify leads to determine if our program is the best fit for them - or not.</p>\n<p>2. How to run a strategy session and teach the core marketing strategy that every client uses.</p>\n<p>3. How to present our program as the solution for their needs and goals.</p>\n<p>4. How to consistently close deals on the first and second call.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Who will you work with?</strong></p>\n<p>You will work directly with Will, the Director of Sales, and our other 3 World-Class High-Ticket Sales Advisors.
