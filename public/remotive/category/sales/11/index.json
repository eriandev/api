In the United States alone over 150 million people lack access to reliable internet connectivity. Globally, over 3 billion people lack access to reliable internet connectivity. The past few years have highlighted just how significant this problem is. Young school children are expected to do more schoolwork than ever online and learn remotely, yet 40% of schools in America lack broadband access for students and educators. The popularity and necessity of telehealth has been magnified, yet 60% of hospitals outside of metro areas do not have broadband access.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Our purpose</strong><br></p>\n<p>Our teams are on a mission to accelerate digital equality, connect communities, and empower people. That's why we come to work every day. Thousands of people in the fiber broadband industry have been working diligently to close the digital divide for years, and that impact is finally gaining some serious momentum behind the events of a global pandemic and a wave of funding opportunities in the United States and dozens of other countries around the world. Being problem solvers and innovators are what we're known for in the market and we leverage that mindset every day to push our teams, our partners, and the market to think differently and more efficiently about the challenges facing our industry.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Our team</strong><br><br>Our culture is a focal point in our hiring process.

We need to be challenged. It's an everyday mission to make a meaningful impact towards digital equality and there is no one perfect answer to the challenge. If we want to say we are building the airplane while we're flying it then it is fair to say we trust our partners to be building the control tower while controlling the airspace and paving the runway while telling us we are clear to land. It's a team sport within our company and between all of our partners in the industry, and just like high performing sports teams we are building a culture where everyone knows how to execute the right plays at the right times. That takes hard work and a willingness to wear different hats to match the different scenarios that may get thrown at us on any given day.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p><p>If you have made it this far then things are already looking up.
