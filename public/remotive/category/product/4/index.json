In business for more than 10 years, we are self-funded, financially independent, profitable, and high growth. We launched our first SaaS product four years ago and have been thrilled with the response -- we’ve more than doubled our user base in the past two years and continue to experience strong growth. Our clients have helped us to crystallize an exciting roadmap for the next few years…and that’s where you come in.</p>\n<p><strong>About This Role</strong></p>\n<p>You'll work closely with multiple members of our team to build innovative, engaging solutions that empower Realtors to grow their businesses. Our customers rely on our products as an essential part of their daily operations, and we're committed to providing them tools to help them succeed in an increasingly competitive landscape. Our entire product team is 100% remote and distributed across multiple time zones, so you’ll need to be comfortable working in this environment.<br><br>As a Product Manager, you'll be tasked with researching and managing the design and development of key features of our web and mobile platforms, as well as assisting members of our sales and marketing team to communicate the value of those features through our website and marketing channels.<br><br>On a day-to-day basis, you'll work closely with our web design and development teams to manage development of new features. While there will be an opportunity to do some simple prototyping and web design within this job, this is <em>not </em>a design position or a programming position. Instead, your main focus will be to plan, guide and supervise feature development from conception through launch, and to assist in promoting the value of those features to existing and prospective clients.<br><br>In a typical day, you'll be managing the development of multiple new features, each at different stages of completion. For one feature, you might spend time soliciting feedback from team members and considering possible use-cases before collaborating with a Product Designer to create a detailed specification. For another feature, you might be providing completed design mockups to our development team, along with specific instructions on how programming should be integrated with the mockups to create an initial working version. For a third feature, you might be working with our development team to continue testing and providing feedback on a new feature in our dev environment, honing it for launch.<br><br>Your primary responsibilities will include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act as project lead to supervise new feature development from initial design requirements all the way through to launch (entire SDLC)</li>\n<li>Develop direct relationships with key clients, soliciting their ideas and feedback to help guide the development of new features and continue to improve the usefulness of existing features</li>\n<li>Work with engineering team to research and provide support to several key teams in the organization</li>\n<li>Help inform our marketing efforts for new features, fashioning them into a compelling story and assisting with GTM</li>\n<li>Work with company leadership, other team members and key clients to maintain a feature development roadmap, establishing priority, backlog grooming, and timeline for each feature</li>\n<li>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get a lot of the things done in writing.
