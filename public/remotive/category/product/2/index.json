We stop ransomware and account takeover attacks in their tracks and dramatically improve the user experience. Beyond Identity’s state-of-the-art platform eliminates passwords and other phishable factors, enabling organizations to confidently validate users’ identities. The solution ensures users log in from authorized devices, and that the device meets the security policy requirements during login and continuously after that. Our revolutionary approach empowers zero trust by cryptographically binding the user’s identity to their device and analyzing hundreds of risk signals on an ongoing basis. The company’s advanced risk policy engine enables organizations to implement foundationally secure authentication and utilize risk signals for protection, rather than just for detection and response.

What makes us stand out in a sea of similar apps? We deeply care about the diasporas and communities we serve — and that comes with a sense of connection to the markets we operate in. We strive to make life better for everyone who touches our product. That means recognizing and honoring the human experience behind sending money. We do that by remaining fee-free in most of our markets and offering round-the-clock customer care.</p>\n<p>Our app is currently available in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and parts of Europe, and sends funds to 19 receiving countries for over 500,000 users. We currently have<a href=\"%22https:/www.trustpilot.com/review/sendwave.com%22\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a 4.6-star rating on Trustpilot</a> — people put their faith in us to deliver their money quickly, securely, and affordably. And we’re pretty darn proud of that.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>How we work</strong></div>\n<p>What we’re most proud of though is our brilliant, creative, and tenacious team. Our remote-first workplace means you’ll be working with Sendwavers in Europe, Africa, South America, and the U.S. that all share a core set of Sendwave values. What exactly are those values? Glad you asked.</p>\n<ol style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Prioritize fearlessly.</strong><strong><br></strong> There will always be more problems to solve and opportunities to pursue than we have the capacity for. We’re not afraid to say no and are willing to let fires burn, knowing that to win we must discern and execute decisively on the vital few rather than the important many.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Take full ownership of the outcomes we’re responsible for.</strong><strong><br></strong>Our job is not to do what we can to solve a problem. It's to ensure that problem is solved. If an attempt to solve a problem doesn't work, we seek an alternative. If we need help, we request it, and, if necessary, demand it.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Forge a diverse team and inclusive culture.</strong><strong><br></strong>We believe the challenges we’re addressing will be best met by a truly global, diverse team, working together. We’re not naive to the systemic bias and discrimination that make this easier said than done, so we check our egos, listen deeply, and measure progress towards making this a fundamental part of our success.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Maximize our rate of learning.</strong><strong><br></strong>We view projects as ever-evolving drafts and welcome opportunities to discover that what we had in mind won't work so we can move to an even better end state. Most importantly, we do this fast. The faster we run these loops — as a company and individuals — the faster we’ll achieve our mission.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Embrace embarrassing honesty from ourselves and others.</strong><strong><br></strong>We function best when we're open and honest with one another — especially about our challenges and doubts. We lean into uncomfortable conversations and support our colleagues when they do the same.</li>\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Maximize energy, not time spent.</strong><strong><br></strong>We measure our own and others’ contributions by objectives reached, not time spent. Living a full life outside of work is necessary for high achievement over the long term.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"h2\">How you’ll help us achieve it</div>\n<p>If you’ve ever seen <a href=\"%22https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R3LWM_Vt70%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Tinder Swindler </a>, <a href=\"%22https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ0KNVU2fV0%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">FYRE</a>, or <a href=\"%22https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=05HK-z6HoHM%22\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Wizard of Lies</a> you know fraud is an infinitely repeating social struggle that leaves the most vulnerable to pay the price. The Risk team at Sendwave builds and supports everything needed to aggregate the individual fraud cases and stop the scheme from ever being lucrative for the fraudster. <br><br>Being the Risk Product Manager will include many typical tasks like exploring vendor tools, coordinating large projects across teams and communicating the status of fraud throughout the company. However, a successful Risk Product Manager will be the creative genius behind the next generation of user verification techniques. <br><br>After the targeted Data Science defenses have detected a potential fraud case the user has the opportunity to move through one of our verification processes and unblock themselves, typically this looks like submitting an ID or speaking with a Support Rep.
