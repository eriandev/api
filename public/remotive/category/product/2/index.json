The passion for music and the excitement for innovative technology have proven to make a good combination.</p>\n<p>We say there’s a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately). Our way of being is always sprinkled with <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bmat.com/careers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">transparency, perseverance, flexibility, open-mindedness and trustworthiness</a>.</p>\n<p>BMAT has grown as a company of companies. Within BMAT there are a number of products and services that developed semi autonomously for different players – Digital Service Providers, Publishers and Collective Management Organisations.</p>\n<p><em>Diverse perspectives drive innovation, and innovation is kind of our thing. Our open-minded and flexible culture organically fosters this diversity. We've learnt that we thrive on learning from each other, so we don't just welcome but actively hire a range of open-minded people from all walks of life. Our team is made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, orientations, abilities, musical tastes, dress sense and time-zones - but we all have one common goal: Making the music world a better place. With equal opportunities for everyone, BMAT is a pretty nice place to work.</em></p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1535670/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1537081,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/product/senior-product-manager-1537081","title":"Senior Product Manager","company_name":"3Pillar Global","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1537081/logo","category":"Product","tags":["excel","product manager","saas","growth","management","design","agile","content","strategy","product strategy","research","product management","Engineering","product","product development","analytics","healthcare","communications","data","retail","business","leadership","metrics","development","implementation","law","media"," team lead","financial services","organization","data-driven","revenue","banking","insurance","digital products","software"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2023-01-07T13:39:48","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<div><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Our Sr. Product Managers work closely with clients and cross-functional teams to build the right things, in the right way at all stages of the product life cycle.</span> <span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt\">Senior Product Managers at 3Pillar have a track record of success delivering digital solutions at scale.

It is an all-in-one tool that supports both the creative and process-oriented aspects of military planning. In Onebrief, planners use maps, boards, diagrams, timelines, spreadsheets, slide decks and text documents to create their plans—all while sharing a common database. Everything stays in sync, in real time. Our approach has been refined and validated through hundreds of user experiments.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re post-revenue ($3M+ in ARR). We are backed by Y Combinator (S21) and top-tier VCs, including Caffeinated Capital (Affirm, Docker, Notion, and more). Our elite team combines the best of tech and military talent, including education and experience at Google, Adobe, MIT, Delta Force, TOPGUN, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Given our current traction we can barely keep up with demand. This is an opportunity for you to join us with all the perks of a founding employee.</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">What you will achieve</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">As a Director of Product Development, your primary responsibility will be to <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">shape</a> our product bets before they are scheduled for implementation. Starting with opportunities identified with our leadership team, you will refine the problem definition, design a high-level solution, mitigate risks and assumption, and establish hard “no-gos,” to make sure that the project can be executed successfully with virtually no risk to schedule.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Shaped bets are rough and unfinished, but they are painstakingly thought through. All the main elements of the solution are there at the macro level and they connect together. The work isn’t specified down to individual tasks, but the overall solution is spelled out. While surprises might still happen, any open questions or rabbit holes we could see up front have been removed to reduce the project’s risk. Shaping bets involves equal parts of product, design and engineering work.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You will have the opportunity to travel and partner with military planners from around the world, empathize with their needs, and translate that into informed product bets. You will collaborate often with leadership, engineering, and design.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">This is a critical position, with significant impact.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You will report directly to Rafa, our CTO and co-founder.</p>\n<div class=\"h1\">About You</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">The ideal candidates are curious and pragmatic “product people” who understand how software products are built from having done it themselves, either as software engineers or “full-stack” designers.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We are especially interested in candidates who have led product initiatives working on B2B/SaaS projects, involving aspects of creative support, data visualization, or modern collaboration.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Qualifications</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You have been involved in the building of software products for several years</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You have led impactful product initiatives, even if Product Manager is not your job title</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You have a comprehensive understanding of the current state of web technologies and best practices</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are naturally inclined to apply a design thinking approach to problem solving, and iteratively seek to understand your users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions which you can prototype and test</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You work effectively with designers and engineers, leading with context, setting clear expectations, and seeking pragmatic solutions</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You have the skills to create simple solutions for complex problems quickly; often benefiting from tried-and-true techniques</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You put user value before tech</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You learn quickly, work iteratively and naturally seek collaboration</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You communicate clearly and succinctly</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You are a U.S. citizen</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Finally, you are a manager of one—capable of setting your own direction, building something from scratch, and seeing it through</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h1\">About Us</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our team shares a passion, seek excellence, and play to win, with the seriousness and camaraderie of an olympic team.
