You'll be building a product that saves lives; multiple Clinical Engineers (ex-MDs and fullstack SWEs) quit lucrative medicine jobs to join Anima for that very reason!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our ambition is to be the OS for all of healthcare and life sciences, through a proprietary active learning, crowdsourcing training architecture - we call it Anima 2.0. We already have one of the biggest, highest quality labelled datasets in the world.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We're profitable, growing at 300-400% MoM, and went from $0 ARR to $1m ARR in 6 months from launch (Apr '22). That's pretty unprecedented in SaaS, never mind healthcare! We have a pretty unique hacker culture at Anima: almost everyone is technical and can code. A 'knights of the round table' structure and thinking from first principles is core to our culture, and is how we've made such rapid progress. It's reflected in how we operate:</p>\n<ol style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">There's no separate product &amp; engineering teams - instead, we have Clinical Engineers who are both their own customers (MDs) and are strong fullstack engs, collaborating with pure software engineers. Due to the quality of our team, there's a heavy focus on coaching and teaching, with minimal to no line management.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We're relentlessly resourceful - in 14 months, we've built an extremely loved enterprise app (NPS = 87) that users have said 'seems too good to be true'. Anima can take an information complete medical history as good or better than a typical human doctor, and automates patient comms and clinical notes.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Anima is a safe haven for free thinkers and we've been careful to build a culture where everyone feels comfortable being their complete self, without ever needing to self-censor. Our hiring acceptance rate is around 0.5-0.8%, which is lower than YC. You're joining hyper elite special forces, and your crewmates will never let you down or waste your time.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We hire candidates from all over the world. We have remote hobs in EU West and NA, and plans to seed some in person teams in those areas too in the next 12 months (in addition to our fully remote teams).</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We have a good time :) we've had team lunches in Duck &amp; Waffle, Breakfast Club, dumplings in Chinatown, had private screenings in our own cinema, booked out the Sky Pool etc. We get the whole team together at least twice a year for team retreats, with the next one planned to be in South Africa.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Join a design-led company where incredible UX is at the core of every line of code, and everything we do</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Great design is built our DNA: Rachel, co-founder and COO, heads the design of all our products. Our thesis is that code <em><strong>serves</strong></em> UX - ideally proprietary UX that users are willing to pay a lot for. We care a lot - we always build clear UX directed graphs (sometimes called user flows) and Figma mockups before beginning architecting or writing a single line of code. We close the loop by using our UX DiGraphs as E2E testing models. We care so much that all our engineers chose to become proficient in Figma :)</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re looking for visionary designer leaders and architects who can think from first principles and have high growth potential - great decision makers who deserve to have complete autonomy and are forces of nature when empowered with it. At the same time, we are deeply collaborative, and through mutual and self-challenge, we converge towards the optimum, and decisively execute. We are united by child-like intellectual curiosity and experiment and wander freely when the right path isn’t clear. We believe all future managers should be formidable ICs &amp; domain experts. Decisions are never made in isolation by the founders. All information is transparently available to the whole team on our Notion - every meeting, decision, success, failure. Anima is a safe refuge for everyone to share their honest thoughts, feelings and be their complete unfiltered self. We offer unlimited holidays and flexibility over work schedule and location.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>The quickest way to get your creations into the hands of users</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">When everyone is UX obsessed, it’s <em>much</em> easier to stay on the same page &amp; execute rapidly. This means we have a super short latency from ideation to real usage - here are two recent examples:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Rachel, co-founder and currently leading design, talked to power users and discovered a critical need for multiple organisations to able to join the same real time multiplayer dashboard. She mocked up a new dashboard in Figma with our engineers, getting async feedback from power users throughout (our users are generally very fanatical and helpful!), and we got it shipped within 5 days!</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Alex (Clinical Engineer), realised that there was a need for care teams to communicate internally and with outside collaborators, and helped Rachel create UX flows and mockups for a game changing feature where virtual care teams could discuss cases and see a single source of truth for the patient history. We managed to get it shipped in 4 weeks!</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Does this sound like you?</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Hungry and wants their shot to change the world - a force of nature when empowered with the tools, resources and development to do it.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Bored and frustrated at big companies; feel held back by red tape, bureaucracy and poor decisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Keen to understand the big picture &amp; entire context of the company and vertical; has a sense of urgency for growth towards a senior executive role.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Have hacked together a cool project in the past, that did something useful, and want to relive that feeling of accomplishment (everyday!).</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">High sigma product intuition and empathy - an uncanny ability to intuit the deepest anxieties and opportunities for user joy even with minimal user research.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Obsessed with optimising UX: quickly able to understand the needs of our users and translate deep anxieties and latent opportunities for excitement and joy into optimal UX flows.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Exceptional attention to detail &amp; an eye for aesthetics that ensure a careful &amp; thorough approach to Figma mockups.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">An excellent communicator: concisely and clearly communicate designs to the team both verbally and through the materials you produce (sketches, wireframes, prototypes etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Able to understand and distil complex concepts &amp; processes and make them accessible for our users in the form of simple, elegant user flows and interactions.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Able to work in an iterative design process, guided by user feedback &amp; company goals; motivated and energised by group critique.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Seeks to maximise not only self productivity, but combined team productivity, communicating the right things at the right time through the right channels (verbal/Slack/Notion).</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Intellectually curious and loves learning - able to tackle entirely novel challenges that lack prior precedent through applying strong design fundamentals and first principles thinking, creatively using the best tools for the job to maximise user delight.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Familiarity with Figma and/or hungry to learn.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We don’t enforce any particular experience level, but you’ll need to demonstrate most of the above through past projects and/or our assessment process.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\"><strong>Our current stack &amp; what to expect from the role</strong></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Here is some information on our technical stack in case you are interested (this may not make much sense to you - that's okay!): we are tech agonistic, and collectively choose the best tools for the job.
