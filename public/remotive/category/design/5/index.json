Sound like your kind of thing? Join an excellent team of motivated design enthusiasts, and turn your day job into something you love. We’ll be happy to check out your portfolio and get back to you!</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Who We Are</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, a bit about us. STRV is a software design and engineering team that delivers next-level products. Here since 2004, we’ve delivered solutions for partners ranging from startups to enterprises, including Barry’s, Microsoft, MedMen, Barnes &amp; Noble, The Athletic, Autodesk, and more.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We focus on mobile applications, websites, backend infrastructure, IoT, blockchain, and data science/ML/AI. We have a footprint in specialized domains like dating, crypto, and mobile gaming. On top of that, we’ve also got some successful internal spin-off projects (like Surge and Zoe), with more in the works — including a space western multiplayer NFT game. Feel free to ask us all about them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The culture is very open and friendly, with everyone on the team self-driven in delivering the highest possible value for clients — because we all care about building partnerships and creating products that make us proud. But you’ve probably scrolled our web and read about all that already. </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">How You Fit In</div>\n<p>You’ll be joining our Design team and will be working on projects that usually last around 3 months and can involve design, development, QA, and product management. Usually, you can expect to work on only one project at a time and be involved from start to finish.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">International Community</div>\n<p>A few things to know: STRV people represent about 26 nationalities, so our official language is English. For people that decide to relocate to the Czech Republic, we’re always happy to provide visa sponsorships and relocation support. And as for meeting our US clients, there may be times you’ll get to visit them — or you may see them strolling through our Prague office since they’re often curious to see the STRV in action and to meet their team in person.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Learning &amp; Other Opportunities</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With over 9 designers, a team lead and a creative director, there’s always someone to consult, have a design feedback session with and learn from. We also host a couple of meetups and workshops, and our designers have a generous conference budget. The occasional trip to conferences worldwide is absolutely on the table.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, in line with our knowledge-sharing mindset, we are all working in Figma, where you can see what everybody is working on in real-time.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">At STRV, Your Role Will Be To</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Confidently describe your design solutions to our clients at all levels</li>\n<li style=\"\">Be responsible for the whole design output on a given project</li>\n<li style=\"\">Collaborate with other designers on projects</li>\n<li style=\"\">Perform as a fearless team player, as you’ll also be collaborating with other departments and supporting them until the project is fully finished</li>\n<li style=\"\">Provide constructive feedback to other designers to help them move forward</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">We Expect You To Have</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">A user-centered product design approach</li>\n<li style=\"\">A natural drive that will fit in with our always curious, tight-knit team; open, honest communication, and the ability to learn are a must</li>\n<li style=\"\">Multiple years of experience in the industry and a mind full of ideas ready to be put into action</li>\n<li style=\"\">The ability to start a project with user flows and wireframes, visually perfecting its UI and finishing it by prototyping and presenting to a client independently</li>\n<li style=\"\">Experience with Figma</li>\n<li style=\"\">Confident English on a high level; due to our primarily US-based clientele, our designers present and consult their work in English</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\">Perks &amp; Benefits</div>\n<p><strong>We want you to feel at home.

Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>About the Team:</strong></div>\n<p>Designing a global ecosystem for knowledge sharing and the platform for businesses to reach this audience requires a multidisciplinary approach. We're building a diverse team with people of different backgrounds and experiences, empowered to shape strategy while moving quickly and learning as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Designers at Quora are building a system to democratize access to all knowledge for the entire world. Our work leverages what we learn about psychological and social dynamics, communities and networks, and systems and policy design, in addition to more typical design skills. Product design plays a significant role in impacting product strategy directly. We work on everything from ranking to UI, from internationalization to moderation systems; design decisions are validated through A/B testing and user studies alike, as we value rigor and empathy in equal measure. We pursue candor, holism, and awareness in our work.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\">About the Role:</div>\n<p>Quora designers are strategic minded. As a product designer, you'll be responsible for what you design from start to finish because designers at Quora control the interface — they have a central role on every product team. This not only ensures the right solution is being designed, but that the right problem is being solved. As an integral part of that structure, you will be embedded in a product team focused on a major, user-facing area of Quora.</p>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Identify and execute high-impact opportunities for your product area, design features in pursuit of business goals, and clearly communicate decision rationale</li>\n<li style=\"\">Partner with research and data science teams to understand the needs of our users, designing scalable solutions with empathy</li>\n<li style=\"\">Collaborate with cross-functional leads for the ongoing improvements</li>\n<li style=\"\">Consult with engineers to develop designs to scale globally across platforms, with designers for feedback and critique, and with data scientists and user researchers to evaluate the impact of your work</li>\n<li style=\"\">Design interactions for new features, applying or contributing to a design system as appropriate</li>\n<li style=\"\">Work autonomously to quickly and pragmatically execute on multiple projects</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Minimum Qualifications:</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\"><strong>Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's \"coordination hours\" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time)</strong></li>\n<li style=\"\">Portfolio demonstrating digital design capabilities across apps and other platforms showcasing effective interaction design and strong visual design</li>\n<li style=\"\">Experience designing products with clear, effective interactions to accomplish business goals</li>\n<li style=\"\">Designed and shipped product features either from scratch or iterating on what existed</li>\n<li style=\"\">Ability to reason at a strategic level about a complex, social product and update perspective with new learnings</li>\n<li style=\"\">Demonstrated record of using data and/or user research to inform and evaluate design solutions</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Preferred Qualifications:</strong></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">Experience with effective A/B testing and metrics driven environment</li>\n<li style=\"\">Experience maintaining and improving a design system</li>\n<li style=\"\">Shipped high quality mobile experiences for social media products</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h3\">Additional Information:</div>\n<p>For Colorado based applicants, the minimum salary range is $129,600 - $132,000 + equity + benefits.
