I’m excited to open this position because it has many responsibilities I want as an engineer. As a product engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll, for example, research competitors, write product specs, and implement features from frontend to backend. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Designed and built automated candidate scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Built a generalized filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Spec-ed, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete the process of signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">These projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered &amp; extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">One formality, we do require at least 1.5 years of experience as a full-time software engineer for this role.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Engineering Culture</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering culture is motivated by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Benji</u></a>’s (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Collaboration is Natural &amp; Communication is Deliberate</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (I wrote about it <a href=\"https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>). </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Increase Leverage, not Team Size</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Great developer tooling.</strong> Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. </strong>At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video on it <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img src=\"https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Give Engineers Ownership &amp; Autonomy</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Put Effort into Diversity </div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Diverse teams <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>drive innovation and better outcomes</u></a>. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<div class=\"h1\">Interview Process</div>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises).

These teams should be spending time with people, but unfortunately all facets of People teams are bogged down by managing processes instead of helping people. That’s where Sora comes in: we’re building a product that streamlines the tedious and repetitive work People teams do every day, from sending emails to assigning onboarding tasks to a new hire’s manager to syncing data across anywhere from 3 to 20 tools in a customer’s HR stack.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re a pure startup, with all the excitement that carries as a foundational member, but with more thoughtfulness than the typical early-stage company. We’re committed to our values and we take our mission seriously.

We’re empathetic, scrappy, nimble, thoughtful and committed to excellence. We listen to our teammates when they raise ideas or concerns. We get to provide input that shapes which features we’ll prioritize as a company, and then we drive the planning, implementation, and release of those features.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We live all over the country and (outside of COVID) love to get together for board games, surfing, cooking, Mario Kart, and more :)</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">You're a full-stack engineer with 8+ years of experience in modern web development and cloud technologies, and some experience in DevOps (CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, production support).
