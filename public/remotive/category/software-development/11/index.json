Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it‚Äôs also introducing a new surface area of risk they‚Äôve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.</p>\n<p>At Metomic, we help tech companies save time &amp; reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world‚Äôs most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio. Our revenue is growing quickly and we‚Äôre backed by some great investors like Connect (investors in CityMapper, Typeform, Marvel), LocalGlobe (Improbable, Figma, Zego) and RFC (Hopin, Clubhouse, On Deck, etc).</p>\n<p><img height=\"427\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RKg3QNZ7xaIx9KOdFS4o9XuTb-wftSRGu-e_zB1H-W70Zo6_8AcivkJh3vbVDi2lIUoBRAucVSRG_hmPQh5LkD4f6kjO-NI8NmDTwWRpFhctHhRTGBmvGnW-KlftRYZxun6U6bVd8XJobtCgSg\" width=\"624\"></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">¬†</div>\n<p><strong>Engineering Team</strong></p>\n<p>As we continue to change the way companies deal with their sensitive data, our Engineering Team (currently 8 strong) is growing and we‚Äôre looking to welcome Software Engineers, either back-end or full-stack, to our team to be part of this journey.</p>\n<p>Some of the areas you may be working on: Our sensitive data and classification engine, building systems to allow us to process billions of messages a day, data ingest pipelines, sensitive data remediation system, risk identification and ranking engines and alerting systems.</p>\n<p>Our back-end services are written in Typescript and make extensive use of Kafka, GraphQL and Postgres.
