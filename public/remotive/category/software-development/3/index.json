Buyers now want instant access to Presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.</p>\n<p>This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team’s productivity, it also removes the \"demo lag time\" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Our Values: </strong></p>\n<p>Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too.
