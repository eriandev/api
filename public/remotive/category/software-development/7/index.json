We're picky about who we partner with; new clients only come in via trusted referral. We've worked with Lyft, McGraw Hill, ClearCo, irl.com, the former CEO of Waze, the leading vaccine production software, several new unicorns we can't say here, and dozens of startups backed by a16z/YC/Softbank/etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Work alongside friends old &amp; new: </strong>our niche is small/diverse product teams, since clients with larger budgets and higher-impact work tell us they want teams, not individuals. Of course, we keep friends together whenever we can.</li>\n<li><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say \"no\" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>\n<li><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep 100% of what you earn: </strong>if you charge $130/hr, you get $130/hr. A·Team makes money by charging a small, flat, transparent platform fee on <em>top</em> of your rate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>How to apply:</strong></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Go here: <a href=\"https://build.a.team/remotivereferral\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://build.a.team/remotivereferral</a> + mention Remotive. </span>No resume or cover letter needed; we respect your time so the application is short.
