We all hate packing, printing, and shipping unwanted items only to wait weeks for a refund … And retailers have it rough too.

Nobody wins.</p>\n<p>This is why ReturnBear exists. We are Canada's first end-to-end reverse logistics solution. Our nationwide drop-off network means immediate exchanges and returns with no re-packing.

You embrace the agile nature of design and development, and you are equally comfortable pivoting your plan and process as you are establishing a workback schedule. Try as we might, things won't always go as planned, and you always try to be ready to deal with that as it comes.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Passion for the problems we're solving.
