However, it is a manual, error-prone and tedious process that takes at least 1 year. Our platform integrates with the companies’ tech stack (like GCP, AWS, Azure, Google Workspaces, Jira, Gitlab, etc.), extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist to become and remain certified. That way we can automate many processes and companies can save 100s of engineering hours working on documentation and excel sheets.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">The fastest company finished their compliance in 4 weeks with us.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"> </p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Why join Secfix</strong></p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">In August 2021 we raised a Pre-Seed round from top angel investors (including the first Flixbus investors Heinz Raufer, Rheinhard Wick, and Torsten Sturm) to build our Minimal Certifiable Product (MCP).
