We know that by connecting people with others' lived experiences, we can better support them to reach their goals faster and with greater care.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Lived?</strong> Lived is an app that supports people to drink less and live more, by connecting them with the support, wisdom and guidance of people who have been there themselves and understand what works.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">✨ About the role</div>\n<p><strong>As Lived's Wizard of Ops, you will…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transform Lived into a well-oiled engine:</strong> As a Senior Operations Lead, you are an expert handle cranker, always on the lookout for ways to improve how things work across all functions at Lived.</p>\n<p>⚙ <strong>Build and grow the heart of the platform—our content machine:</strong> You'll be owning the full lifecycle of the content experience: recruiting, training, onboarding and incentivising creators, through to scaling and optimising content creation processes and monitoring. Figuring out what to optimise, which levers to pull, and when, will be your craft.</p>\n<p><strong>‍ Translate our vision into action:</strong> Lived has huge global ambitions. ****You'll be tasked with breaking down the vision into actionable, efficient and effective plans that empower and operationalise all teams at Lived. You will take complex projects and contextualise, structure, and wrap them up in a bloody big ribbon. You love your numbers, you're super analytical and you make calls that are driven by insight, nuance and data. This is quite an operationally technical role so will need to be comfortable with technology, excel, automation tools, and mentoring data analysts— and you won't mind getting your hands dirty if needed.</p>\n<p><strong> Be the glue that bands us together:</strong> You will grow and drive operational excellence at Lived. This will include helping the team set, align and track OKR's; supporting the company and CEO with strategic planning, financial reporting and budgeting (via accountants); and making sure to keep us safe and out of trouble (working with our lawyers on legal contracts, liabilities and risk mitigation). You will be agile in your approach, and won't be phased by the challenges that start-up life throws at you…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Let's talk about you.</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>⭐ You're a born leader</p>\n<p>The scope is broad and bright, and the potential for growth to a Leadership role is huge. That doesn't faze you. You will naturally be the type of human that wants to have an outsized impact in the business. One: because you want to grow, but two: because you have likely done it before and are a strong generalist.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p> You eat collaboration for breakfast</p>\n<p>While you will thrive on this huge mountain to climb, you won't run this trek solo. You'll collaborate incredibly closely with our cross-functional team. You will have support from our Community Lead, Arielle, who is the brightest human rallying our Guide and member communities, our Head of Marketing, Lauren who will not rest until we build one of the most human and accessible brands on the planet, and our Head of Product Ridhi who's excellent at both dreaming up the most ambitious product vision while being so grounded in executing it. This powerhouse team having your back will not only ensure sure you succeed but will grow you personally and professionally in ways the English language has no words for.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You can do this in your sleep, (you have done this type of role before)</p>\n<p>You have some battle scars either personally and/or professionally that have allowed you to grow. To others, tasks you commit to seem like they will take a week, then you pop up in Slack saying \"done, folks\" hours later. You wow the team with most things you do, but sometimes you mess up, and that is ok. You're likely someone who has had some experience building a marketplace, being a leader, being a life-long learner and you have experienced first-hand, the highs and lows of rapid growth.</p>\n<p><strong> To be overly transparent on this one, we really need people who have done a similar role before, at scale, in tech, and preferably globally.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You're a role model and you lead with pride</p>\n<p>You are comfortable and skilled at leading to ensure everyone is engaged, effective, and growing. You're a natural connector and are able to bring cross-functional groups together to elevate outcomes. Your crystal ball vision helps you stay a few steps ahead and you proactively seek to fill gaps in your knowledge. You have this odd but profound ability to anticipate problems most do not know will exist.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>❤ You care, a lot</p>\n<p>Like a-lot, a-lot. You will often hear the expression \"be a good human\" at Lived. (i.e. don't eat the last cookie in the cookie jar without filling it up. If something takes your teammate 30 minutes and you 3 minutes, do it for them. And if you know someone is nervous about a big preso, volunteer private time so they can practice with you). These random acts of goodness should come naturally to you, without overt thought or thinking of \"wow I really went out of my way\". It's just how you are wired.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You're practical &amp; anchored</p>\n<p>You are likely a COO type or not far off, but actually - you have decided you miss getting your hands dirty and you want to scale again with a company FULL of energy, vision, and mission.

From the goals we set to the way we hire; the products we build, to the way we speak—people are always the priority. We hire extraordinary humans and look way beyond just their capabilities. Our team don't miss doctor's appointments or our friend's birthdays—because we're people first and employees second. We're building products to drive better human connection and inclusion. We support 'people living with addiction' and <em>never</em> 'addicts'. We thrive on this connection to ourselves, our peers, our community and our cause.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Clear is kind</p>\n<p>We are highly transparent and embrace vulnerability—and see the extraordinary power in both of those things.

We don't shy away from tough conversations, but we always consider who may be listening.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Listen carefully</p>\n<p>We never have all of the answers. We never assume.

We are a small, but successful agency that’s been around for over 10 years on the market. This allows us to really know the people we’re working with every day. If there’s a problem, we support and help each other, just like that.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  We know that people hate spending hours in unproductive meetings so we simply don’t waste any time in them if our input is not needed. We’re also not fans of corporate talk and endless procedures either. Do you want to leave earlier or start later? Maybe you have Pilates at 11AM? No problem, we’re open to talk about your weekly plans and tailor your working hours.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  We also value our team’s independence and we want you to make good choices for yourself. You don’t feel like working from home today? Come to the office. Fully remote? Sure, not a problem for us, just choose what’s comfortable for you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  As we’re all either IT or data or marketing nerds, we understand that continuous development is part of the job, and we encourage people to learn more and be better. That’s why each month (during working hours) you can spend 16 hours participating in the training you choose (and we’ll even finance it for you – just choose a course that will help you grow in your role).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  We’re also open (like really open!) to new ideas. Do you see a possible improvement to an existing project? Implement it and make your life easier. Do you know software that can make our work more productive? Talk to us about it and we’ll be happy to introduce it for the whole team. We just know that once you’re happy with your job, it’ll also be a pleasure for our clients to work with us.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Job description</strong> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">  Laurens Coster has been on the market for 10 years.
