We need people who aren’t just interested in working at a startup; we need people who are excited about building a great company. In addition to function-specific skills, here are some traits that enable our team members to thrive:</p>\n<ul style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Ego-less Learner</strong> -- Every day at Pulley, we are trying things that we’ve never done before - sometimes they work; sometimes they don’t. To be successful here, you need to embrace that feeling of ‘being a beginner’ and be willing to accept feedback in stride. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Less Talk; More Action</strong> -- Everyone rolls up our sleeves at Pulley. If your strength is being the ‘idea gal or guy’ but you don’t create your own slides or write your own code, then we are not a great fit.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\"><strong>Prioritize ruthlessly</strong> - Our view is that being a <a href=\"https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>10x engineer</u></a> is not about writing more code; it’s about making the right decision on what to build. We’re hiring for people who can make the right strategic decisions on where to spend their time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">We’re also inspired by the culture work done at other companies and plan to develop our own playbook here too. One of the concepts that resonate most with us is the importance of <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/21-Great_Workplace_isStunning_ColleaguesGreat_workplace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>stunning colleagues</u></a>.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">If you like the sound of our environment and you’re passionate about joining a team like the one we’ve described, we'd love to talk!</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1444043/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1444452,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/customer-support/customer-success-champion-1444452","title":"Customer Success Champion","company_name":"Photobooth Supply Co","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1444452/logo","category":"Customer Service","tags":["education","ios","sales","management","strategy","customer success","customer service","business","account management","onboarding","chat","engagement","IT","macOS","hubspot","communication","webinars","software"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2022-10-27T03:39:10","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<p>We call this position a \"Customer Success Champion” because it's your job to do just that: champion and lead our customers to success.
