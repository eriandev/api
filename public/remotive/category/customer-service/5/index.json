It enables citizens, companies and governments to make clearer choices about who they do business with. It throttles crime, helps protect workers and our environment. It oils the wheels of prosperity, fairness and sustainability.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OpenCorporates was conceived to drive that change. We’ve worked with bodies like <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">the World Bank</a> and <a href=\"https://www.g20.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the G20</a> to spearhead initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://registries.opencorporates.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Company Data Index</a> and the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.gleif.org/en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>. Our expertise has shaped how the US Federal Government procures services; we have advised the European Commission on <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/legislation-open-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">the EU Open Data Directive</a>; and we were instrumental in the UK Companies House opening access to their company data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And then there’s the OpenCorporates data platform that holds the largest open database of companies in the world.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our platform dynamically captures and curates the records of over 200 million companies from 140 jurisdictions around the world — openly available information that is the foundation to sourcing, risk, compliance, and investigations processes for organisations around the world — large and small, public and private.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But we’ve just got started. We’re aiming to become the world’s go-to source of foundation data company information. This is where you come in:</p>\n<div class=\"h2\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\"><strong>The Role:</strong></span></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a business we are committed to open, transparent company information. The scale of the data we share leads to numerous enquiries, customer contact and other requests. Our Customer Service Desk Manager will primarily be responsible for managing a team of customer-facing Agents. You will utilise your experience to drive a systematic programme of process improvement, from ticket resolution, streamlining support processes and making sure the right team has access to the insights the helpdesk generates to guide product improvements. <br><br>We expect you to act as the escalation point for complex matters as well as offering support and guidance to the team to enable them to deal with such matters, moving forward that are systematic in nature. As the company increases the number of customers we serve, jurisdictions we cover and volume of data we transact, the workload of the Customer Service Desk will also increase, so we would love to find somebody who keeps scalability in mind when proposing solutions. As the workload dictates, you may be required to handle parts of the workload directly. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\">Required Experience:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Experience managing a customer-facing help desk or service desk, ideally in a modern software environment</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An understanding and experience of working within an Agile environment</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Excellent knowledge of ITIL</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Great communication skills (particularly written)</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Experience with a range of service desk software such as Jira Service Desk (ideal), ZenDesk, Freshdesk or similar</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\">Desired Experience:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Exposure of dealing with detailed processes of a compliance/regulated area, such as Data Protection (UK/EU GDPR)</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Startup/scale up experience in a tech/software/online company</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\"><strong>Benefits:</strong></span></div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Competitive salary</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Share options scheme</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Flexible hours</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remote-first working</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">28 days holiday plus bank holidays</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Company Bonus</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1 day additional holiday each year</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Time off for life events</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">£500 home office budget</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cycle to work scheme</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Quarterly socials</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wellbeing Pledge</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Life assurance</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">£1000 learning and wellness allowance, plus learning days</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"color: #c0504d;\">Diversity Matters:</span></strong></div>\n<p>Don’t meet every single requirement below?

But today consumers choose businesses based on online reputation and digital experiences. The modern marketer must deliver exceptional experiences that create repeat customers, and they need a platform that can do this at scale. Local businesses often struggle to overcome the complexity and inefficiencies that come from using multiple applications to manage and optimize their marketing and customer experience operations. They often find that their use of fragmented point solutions keeps them from achieving true customer insights - and from acting upon them in real time.</p><p>This is the challenge that Birdeye solves with its all-in-one reputation and customer experience platform. More than 90,000 local businesses and brands use Birdeye to be found online through local listings and reviews; engage with consumers through webchat, text, and social media messaging; collect digital payments; and gain insights to improve customer experience with survey, ticketing and benchmarking tools.</p><p>Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Palo Alto, Birdeye is led by a team of industry experts and innovators from Google, Amazon, Salesforce, and Yahoo and in 2021, our CEO and Co-founder was named 2021 EY Entrepreneur of the Year.
