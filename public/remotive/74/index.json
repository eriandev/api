Solstice connects households and community organizations to “community solar”—shared solar farms that are installed in a centralized location where local residents can enroll in a portion for free, without any home installations, and enjoy guaranteed savings on their monthly utility bill.</em></p><p><em>One of the only companies in the solar industry co-founded and led by women of color, Solstice has generated demand for nearly 139MW of clean energy across 43 community renewable projects in multiple states, with the total clean energy capacity from enrolled households, small businesses, and nonprofits representing the environmental equivalent of not burning 62 million pounds of coal. In addition, Solstice’s software manages the end-to-end customer experience for the life of the 20-year renewable energy project on behalf of developers and financiers, from customer enrollment to billing/crediting to ongoing customer engagement.</em></p><p><em>Solstice was founded to advance equity and inclusion in America. We are committed to living those values, not just in the work we do to promote environmental and energy justice, but in how we grow as an organization. We always seek to expand leadership opportunities for marginalized communities in the global transition to clean energy.</em></p><p><em>Solstice is an equal-opportunity employer.
