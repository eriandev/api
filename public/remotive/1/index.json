We have inclusive remote events and we get together annually for a fun off-site retreat.</div>\n<div><strong>Well-being</strong> - You'll have solid health, dental, and vision plans; access to 401k, and a generous maternity and paternity leave.</div>\n<div><strong>Fair pay</strong> - Each role has a defined salary band, bands and salaries are audited on a regular basis to help maintain fairness and market value</div>\n<div><strong>Home office and tech budget</strong> - Besides paying for your work computer (Mac or PC), we offer a one-time $1000 home office stipend and an additional $500 annual budget for extra work-related technology.</div>\n<div><strong>Coworking space, on us</strong> - Home office not cutting it? We'll reimburse your monthly coworking fees.</div>\n<div><strong>Equity </strong>- We want everyone invested in our success.
