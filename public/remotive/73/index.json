We do this by giving solar installers super powers with our innovative software. This allows them to work much more effectively and install even more solar installations. With our software installers can easily design, sell and maintain solar power systems remotely. We are active in 3 countries and are about to expand our horizon internationally. We have seen the Dutch market grow x5 within 5 years and are ready to see the same impact in the rest of Europe!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The role of marketing is becoming increasingly important. Especially in new markets we need to start from scratch with very little brand awareness. To grow quickly we need to stir up the market, tell our story in appealing ways and attract the success we are looking for!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About the job:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marketing is about telling the story of Solar Monkey. And we have some great stories to tell!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your tasks and responsibilities will entail:</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As head of marketing you are ultimately responsible for making sure that our stories get told with as much impact as possible. One key metric of course is the direct number of leads generated (SQL/MQL). But we see marketing much broader than just leads. Along the customer journey marketing is responsible for consistent story telling, helping our sales team to increase sales conversion and close more deals. Also marketing has a role for spreading the word helping us to gather job applicants or business partners. We believe there is much hidden value in just being out there and positioning ourselves as an authority in the market.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although marketing is about storytelling, we aim to measure every single step in the process. You are responsible for making sure that every step can be measured and that this is done in a structured way. Using these insights you run an improvement cycle to continuously optimise our impact. We need to know the results and ROI of each campaign so we know what to scale up and what to scale down. Continuous experimentation and measuring results will help to find better ways.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You will lead the Marketing team at Solar Monkey. This is currently only 2 FTE, but we envision to grow to &gt;5 FTE internally within a year. We also work with marketing agency Happy Horizon and a number of freelancers such as international copywriters. All will fall under your responsibility. You report directly to Jan Pieter, the CEO.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Which channels we use to expose our stories? Of course we have our own website that needs to be optimised on SEO and conversion. We use social media channels to increase exposure and generate traffic and leads. We advertise on Google, Linked in and through partners. And when we have something cool to share we make sure to connect with the press to help spread our message.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You keep abreast of what's going on in the market and incorporate it into marketing campaigns. SO you need to gain sufficient market insights to know what is intersting to share, and how to best reach our target audiences.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also internally you are the face of marketing. You gather interesting stories from your colleagues and keep everyone updated on how we communicate with the outside world.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What's in it for you.</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On top of the salary: Stock Appreciation Rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A training budget of 4% of your annual salary.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Macbook</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A challenging journey within an ambitious scale-up. Tons of responsibility and a good bunch of people to celebrate successes with.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remote and Hybrid friendly culture. The flexibility to work where and when it fits you best and a budget to set up your workspace at home.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Monthly social events and quarterly strategy days (company wide events also for remote workers). Enough opportunity to have fun with your colleagues ;)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where will you be doing this?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our headquarters is in The Hague, and many creative ideas are best generated in real life collaboration. So it is useful if you can be at the office at least 1-2 days per week. We do have a remote friendly culture and in fact almost half the company works remote. So you will enjoy lots of freedom on where and when to do your work. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who are we looking for? </strong></p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Someone who is performance driven but who understands that health and wellbeing are a prerequisite for performing.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You have experience with <strong>SaaS</strong> and <strong>B2B</strong> marketing</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You are creative and love to try new things. You are eager to learn and see failure as an opportunity, not something to be prevented.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You know how to set up a customer journey, measure all steps in the process and how to optimise results of each step.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Experienced in leading a team. The team is not super large, so we are not looking for a typical ‘manager’, more a pragmatic entrepreneurial type who gets things done with the team.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want you to focus your storytelling on people. We love the personal touch and want you to engage with clients to really learn what they are up to. So you need to be outgoing enough to engage with them, rather than just working digital only.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Storytelling, copywriting should be one of your skills. You should be fluent in English. Dutch is nice to have. We can work around language skills through local copy writers. We will be active in 5 languages so it’s impossible for you to speak them all ;)</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You should know how to visualise stories for maximum impact. Some skills in doing this yourself is useful.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You are located in the <strong>Netherlands</strong>. </p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You are fluent in <strong>Dutch</strong> and <strong>English</strong>, Spanish, German, or French is a pre.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to have acquired those skills we think you would need <strong>6+ years</strong> of experience in marketing. But to be honest, we don’t look much at resumes and would rather have you prove to use that you possess the required skills.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1521602/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1524709,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/sales/account-associate-1524709","title":"Account Associate","company_name":"Brkfst","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1524709/logo","category":"Sales","tags":["ADS","education","content","data analysis","data","customer service","creative","people","social platforms","presentations","communication","agency","insurance","client relationships"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2022-12-15T09:40:28","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<p>We are <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://brkfst.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brkfst.io</a> and we connect creators with big brands to make impactful ads at scale.
