We strive to make life better for everyone who touches our product. That means recognizing and honoring the human experience behind sending money. We do that by remaining fee-free in most of our markets and offering round-the-clock customer care.</p>\n<p>Our app is currently available in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and parts of Europe, and sends funds to 19 receiving countries for over 500,000 users. We currently have<a href=\"%22https:/www.trustpilot.com/review/sendwave.com%22\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a 4.6-star rating on Trustpilot</a> — people put their faith in us to deliver their money quickly, securely, and affordably.
