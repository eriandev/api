Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances. ONE’s vision is exceedingly simple and profound: to build one app that consumers use every day to manage all of their money. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">There’s never been a better moment to build a business that empowers consumers to improve their financial lives.
