Judo helps designers fully imagine and envision what's possible, by putting them in the driver's seat and giving them complete control from concept to completion.</p>\n<p>The output from Judo is more than a static image and more than a prototype—it is a fully functional app UI that is ready to be shipped to users instantly, without having to submit to the App/Play store.</p>\n<p>Judo's iOS and Android SDKs are installed in close to 100 different apps reaching millions of users. Some of our customers include DraftKings, Cabela's, Chicago Bulls and New England Patriots.</p>\n<p>We're backed by the same group that funded Shippabo, Airtable, LaunchKit and more (TenOneTen and Freestyle VC), a top U.S. accelerator as well as several prominent angel investors. We've built a solid reputation with several major sports franchises as clients, and are now charting new territory as we explore the multitude of other industries who could benefit from incorporating Judo into their native app workflows.</p>\n<p>Our name derives from the martial art, a key principle of which is “maximum efficiency with minimal effort”.
