As much as possible, they'll purchase things with Glo rather than USD, EUR, etc. As they do this, we're able to generate and support the basic income for people who live in extreme poverty, which is going to be very exciting. </p>\n<p>Building community at Glo is going to be unlike anywhere else. We're sparking a social movement of people who use Glo as a currency because they want to see the number of basic income recipients going up. Unlike most stablecoins, no one is making money here (except the basic income recipients of course). The reason we're collectively brute-forcing this currency into existence is because it's our best shot at enacting a scalable basic income. </p>\n<p>The fundamental way for people to get involved is to use Glo as money. Convert some percentage of your monthly income into Glo; try to purchase things with it. In the beginning, this will almost be a hobby—few places will accept Glo and payment infrastructure will be meh. But by pioneering Glo usage, the community creates an incentive for payment providers to start supporting Glo and for merchants to accept it. </p>\n<p>Eventually, paying with Glo becomes just as easy as any other method. At that point it's an ethical choice, akin to driving electric or eating less meat. If you're pro basic income and want a fairer economy, pay with Glo.
