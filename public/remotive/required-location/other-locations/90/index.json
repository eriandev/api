In the United States alone over 150 million people lack access to reliable internet connectivity. Globally, over 3 billion people lack access to reliable internet connectivity. The past few years have highlighted just how significant this problem is. Young school children are expected to do more schoolwork than ever online and learn remotely, yet 40% of schools in America lack broadband access for students and educators. The popularity and necessity of telehealth has been magnified, yet 60% of hospitals outside of metro areas do not have broadband access.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Our purpose</strong><br></p>\n<p>Our teams are on a mission to accelerate digital equality, connect communities, and empower people.

If we want to say we are building the airplane while we're flying it then it is fair to say we trust our partners to be building the control tower while controlling the airspace and paving the runway while telling us we are clear to land. It's a team sport within our company and between all of our partners in the industry, and just like high performing sports teams we are building a culture where everyone knows how to execute the right plays at the right times.
