We know that by connecting people with others' lived experiences, we can better support them to reach their goals faster and with greater care.</p>\n<p><strong>What is Lived?</strong> Lived is an app that supports people to drink less and live more, by connecting them with the support, wisdom and guidance of people who have been there themselves and understand what works.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">✨ About the role</div>\n<p><strong>As Lived's Wizard of Ops, you will…</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transform Lived into a well-oiled engine:</strong> As a Senior Operations Lead, you are an expert handle cranker, always on the lookout for ways to improve how things work across all functions at Lived.</p>\n<p>⚙ <strong>Build and grow the heart of the platform—our content machine:</strong> You'll be owning the full lifecycle of the content experience: recruiting, training, onboarding and incentivising creators, through to scaling and optimising content creation processes and monitoring. Figuring out what to optimise, which levers to pull, and when, will be your craft.</p>\n<p><strong>‍ Translate our vision into action:</strong> Lived has huge global ambitions. ****You'll be tasked with breaking down the vision into actionable, efficient and effective plans that empower and operationalise all teams at Lived. You will take complex projects and contextualise, structure, and wrap them up in a bloody big ribbon. You love your numbers, you're super analytical and you make calls that are driven by insight, nuance and data. This is quite an operationally technical role so will need to be comfortable with technology, excel, automation tools, and mentoring data analysts— and you won't mind getting your hands dirty if needed.</p>\n<p><strong> Be the glue that bands us together:</strong> You will grow and drive operational excellence at Lived. This will include helping the team set, align and track OKR's; supporting the company and CEO with strategic planning, financial reporting and budgeting (via accountants); and making sure to keep us safe and out of trouble (working with our lawyers on legal contracts, liabilities and risk mitigation). You will be agile in your approach, and won't be phased by the challenges that start-up life throws at you…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Let's talk about you.</div>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>⭐ You're a born leader</p>\n<p>The scope is broad and bright, and the potential for growth to a Leadership role is huge. That doesn't faze you. You will naturally be the type of human that wants to have an outsized impact in the business. One: because you want to grow, but two: because you have likely done it before and are a strong generalist.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p> You eat collaboration for breakfast</p>\n<p>While you will thrive on this huge mountain to climb, you won't run this trek solo. You'll collaborate incredibly closely with our cross-functional team. You will have support from our Community Lead, Arielle, who is the brightest human rallying our Guide and member communities, our Head of Marketing, Lauren who will not rest until we build one of the most human and accessible brands on the planet, and our Head of Product Ridhi who's excellent at both dreaming up the most ambitious product vision while being so grounded in executing it. This powerhouse team having your back will not only ensure sure you succeed but will grow you personally and professionally in ways the English language has no words for.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You can do this in your sleep, (you have done this type of role before)</p>\n<p>You have some battle scars either personally and/or professionally that have allowed you to grow. To others, tasks you commit to seem like they will take a week, then you pop up in Slack saying \"done, folks\" hours later. You wow the team with most things you do, but sometimes you mess up, and that is ok. You're likely someone who has had some experience building a marketplace, being a leader, being a life-long learner and you have experienced first-hand, the highs and lows of rapid growth.</p>\n<p><strong> To be overly transparent on this one, we really need people who have done a similar role before, at scale, in tech, and preferably globally.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You're a role model and you lead with pride</p>\n<p>You are comfortable and skilled at leading to ensure everyone is engaged, effective, and growing. You're a natural connector and are able to bring cross-functional groups together to elevate outcomes. Your crystal ball vision helps you stay a few steps ahead and you proactively seek to fill gaps in your knowledge. You have this odd but profound ability to anticipate problems most do not know will exist.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>❤ You care, a lot</p>\n<p>Like a-lot, a-lot. You will often hear the expression \"be a good human\" at Lived. (i.e. don't eat the last cookie in the cookie jar without filling it up. If something takes your teammate 30 minutes and you 3 minutes, do it for them. And if you know someone is nervous about a big preso, volunteer private time so they can practice with you). These random acts of goodness should come naturally to you, without overt thought or thinking of \"wow I really went out of my way\". It's just how you are wired.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>You're practical &amp; anchored</p>\n<p>You are likely a COO type or not far off, but actually - you have decided you miss getting your hands dirty and you want to scale again with a company FULL of energy, vision, and mission. You're comfortable zooming into and executing the detail, and also has the sixth sense of knowing when to zoom out and think strategy.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Self-aware and vulnerable</p>\n<p>This role is larger than life and we don't believe in unicorns.

People who are living examples of what's possible. People who actually know what it takes.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\">Our values</div>\n<p>Values are actions not just ideas. They inform the way we treat each other and those we support, as well as the products and experiences we build. With a shared understanding of our values, we can go further together.</p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>People are the priority. Period.</p>\n<p>Lived is built by and for real people. From the goals we set to the way we hire; the products we build, to the way we speak—people are always the priority. We hire extraordinary humans and look way beyond just their capabilities. Our team don't miss doctor's appointments or our friend's birthdays—because we're people first and employees second. We're building products to drive better human connection and inclusion. We support 'people living with addiction' and <em>never</em> 'addicts'. We thrive on this connection to ourselves, our peers, our community and our cause.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Clear is kind</p>\n<p>We are highly transparent and embrace vulnerability—and see the extraordinary power in both of those things. We value inclusivity, direct communication, candid feedback and high respect for one another. Our circle of trust enables us to work better, smarter and faster.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Lead with pride</p>\n<p>Shame and stigma have no place in addiction—or at Lived. We couldn't be more proud of the people and community we support, and we sing it loud and proud. Our bold mission is matched by our determination. We stick to our word and will always do what's right over what's easy. We don't shy away from tough conversations, but we always consider who may be listening.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Listen carefully</p>\n<p>We never have all of the answers. We never assume. We seek to understand. The conversation around addiction and how we best support people will be constantly evolving—and we'll always be listening, and pushing ourselves to learn and grow.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>‍♂ </strong>The process we run (so we BOTH know what good likes like)</div>\n<p> </p>\n<ul style=\"\">\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Hit apply and follow the prompts If your CV is longer than 2 pages long, try again)</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>A short recorded video interview for us to get to know you better!</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>First interview: You interview the Founder — 40 minutes</p>\n<p>Yup, your opportunity to ask our CEO anything you like, after all this is also about us convincing you to work with us.

This will either be with our Head Coach, Head of Product or Head of Marketing but don't worry you will meet them all later in the process. Great leaders want to work with other great leaders.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Case study — You present back to the entire team.</p>\n<p>This is your chance to convince the wider team, we are still a small team and we are all about inclusion and involving everyone in the process. This is actually less about the case study and more about your insight, how you communicate, and for us to see how your brain will work. The expectation is you spend no more than an hour or two on this. Likely an interesting operational challenge.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Lunch with the team.</p>\n<p>In person If you're a Sydney sider, if not - we can jump on a zoom call.</p>\n</li>\n<li style=\"\">\n<p>Final culture interview — With someone outside of the business, we trust.</p>\n<p>You will get to meet one of our investors.
