Our mission is to encourage founders to use equity as a lever for business growth.</p>\n<p>We are an innovative, fast growing fintech startup with big ambitions, and our team is on a mission to increase equity inclusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The role</strong></p>\n<p>As our In-house Counsel, you will be a key member of the team with a remit to shape and develop this area of the business. You’ll join a team that is still below 100 people that passionately believes in the power of sharing ownership. This is a fantastic opportunity to really make your mark as we continue to scale up.</p>\n<p>As a legal tech business we support our clients in a number of different areas - not just share schemes, but also helping them through the implications of Shareholder Agreements, Articles of Associations, Investment Agreements, and company equity structures. Critically we are helping them with how all these elements interplay with the platform as they develop and grow.</p>\n<p>You will be interacting with customers as they work out how best to combine their current legal arrangements and corporate governance rules with our digital solutions. You will be helping us develop and map out the various digital support we can give to our customers (in respect of the various legal agreements). You will interface with our external counsel (alongside Vestd’s Directors).</p>\n<p>You will be a qualified lawyer (whether private practice or in house) who has had at least 3 years corporate experience dealing with SME’s in the UK. You will be very familiar with how early stage and scale up companies grow and evolve - whether through investment rounds or organically. You will be fascinated by these corporate journeys and get a real kick out of helping them on the way. Having had some exposure to share schemes is important, but is not a deal breaker.</p>\n<p>If you are still in a law firm, you will be frustrated by the pace of change and slow adoption of technology. You will be really keen to apply your knowledge and experience in a rapidly changing digital environment, that is on the cutting edge of what is possible.</p>\n<p>You will be inspired by the thought of helping to build a business that can really make a difference. You will thrive in ambiguity and relish new challenges.</p>\n<p>It is likely that job content and doing something worthwhile is more important to you than just maximising your salary at all costs.</p>\n<p>If you’re a flexible, commercial, digitally oriented corporate lawyer looking to do something a bit different, then this role could be a great fit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead on all legal issues that the company faces</li>\n<li>Support the development of company strategy from a legal perspective</li>\n<li>Oversee development of the various agreements and contracts that the platform utilises</li>\n<li>Lead the training of the team as appropriate on our legal agreements and contracts</li>\n<li>Be the point of escalation for all customer queries on legal issues</li>\n<li>Maintain an oversight of the various regulatory and corporate regimes within which we operate</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The core skills we are looking for are as follows, with bonus points on offer to help you really stand out from the pack:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Essential</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimum of three years qualified experience in corporate law, focussing on SME’s.</li>\n<li>Ability to understand and empathise with customers and prospects.</li>\n<li>Experience of developing relationships with C-level business leaders.</li>\n<li>First rate communication skills (written, verbal and presentation).</li>\n<li>A great problem solver that loves to help other people.</li>\n<li>Enjoy working remotely and being part of a remote team.</li>\n<li>Brilliant at prioritisation.</li>\n<li>Must thrive on continuous learning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bonus points</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding shares and equity, how UK limited companies are generally structured and the types of share schemes SMEs typically use</li>\n<li>Experience drafting and/or advising on option agreements</li>\n<li>B2B SaaS experience</li>\n<li>Experience of working in a remote team</li>\n<li>A passion for startup life</li>\n<li>Entrepreneurial experience</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What you can expect</strong></p>\n<p>Vestd is a fast-growing, ambitious and progressive startup.
