This is accomplished through research and analysis, public advocacy leadership, and partnership with the private sector. CATF is highly respected for its deep expertise and research on energy and industrial systems and potential strategies, technologies, and policies that can radically shrink their impact on the planet's atmosphere. Our team of 100+ experts and advocates (and global network of subject matter experts and civil society partners) put this research and knowledge into action by designing and enacting public policies that drive toward zero emissions. We also support policies and work directly with private industry to innovate in technology to make the path to zero emissions swift and affordable.  CATF is headquartered in Boston, and has offices in Washington D.C. and Brussels with staff working virtually around world.</p>\n<p>CATF's Zero-Carbon Fuels (ZCF) program aims to accelerate the development and deployment of zero-carbon fuels, namely hydrogen and ammonia, to reduce emissions in time to achieve the Paris Agreement's midcentury goals. These fuels have the potential to reduce costs for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors and could unlock additional opportunities for future decarbonization across the wider global energy system. CATF has identified six sectors that are especially challenging to decarbonize, and for which zero-carbon fuels could be particularly advantageous: marine shipping, heavy-duty long-haul trucking, ironmaking, high-temperature industrial process heating, aviation, and long-duration energy storage. CATF is executing on its comprehensive, multi-faceted approach for zero-carbon fuels and within each of these sectors with rigorous analysis, public policy design, public education and advocacy, identification of needed innovation initiatives, and promotion of demonstration projects such as hydrogen hubs.</p>\n<p><strong>ROLE</strong></p>\n<p>The Senior Policy Manager will collaborate with the Global Program Director and other senior program staff to develop and promote policy in the EU and member states to expand the role of ZCF in heavy transportation and decarbonize heavy industries, as well as other sectors.
