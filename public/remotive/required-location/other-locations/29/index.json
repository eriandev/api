We believe the world will be a better place if every citizen has access to information to make informed decisions about their vote in every election in which they are eligible to vote: primary, general, and special elections; federal, state, and local offices.</p>\n<p>We work diligently to present the available information about elections, candidates, judges, ballot measures, policies, and more in a way that enables our readers to vote with confidence and to act as engaged citizens outside of the polling booth.</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia readers, like Ballotpedia staff, are special people.</p>\n<p>When we launched in 2007, we did not go out of our way to seek new readers. Starting with our small team of visionary idealists, nerds, and aspiring political journalists, we just wrote the best unbiased online articles we could, especially about ballot measures. Readers found those articles in droves. It turns out there was an unclaimed audience out there—people who wanted straightforward facts about political issues, and were willing to read at length instead of just scanning the headlines.</p>\n<p>“If you build it, they will come:'' our readers came to our neutral oasis in growing numbers; we’ve had many millions of lifetime pageviews, we reached nearly half of all voters in 2020, and, in the month surrounding the November 2020 election, we were the 77th most-visited website in the U.S.</p>\n<p>We’ve come to realize that we need to meet our readers where they are. In doing so, over the past five years, we’ve grown our email newsletter program from infancy to include more than 1,000,000 opt-in subscribers with more than a dozen newsletters to choose from. We are working in numerous ways to help put our neutral information in front of people at the times when they most need it, including on mobile phones while you’re standing in the voting booth. We firmly believe that our readers, and the mindset we help them cultivate, are essential in a world where too many others are fighting to get us all addicted to sensational posts and the irrational decisions they foster.</p>\n<p>If this is a mission you’d be willing to work hard to achieve, and if this is a team you’d be willing to work hard with—JOIN US.</p>\n<img src=\"https://remotive.com/job/track/1535018/blank.gif?source=public_api\" alt=\"\"/>"},{"id":1500080,"url":"https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/product/product-owner-1500080","title":"Product Owner","company_name":"Human API","company_logo":"https://remotive.com/job/1500080/logo","category":"Product","tags":["api","product manager","saas","scrum","growth","agile","B2B","customer success","product","healthcare","product owner","data","Enterprise","business","privacy","people","enterprise software","culture","development","IT","integrations","organization","applications","communication","revenue","support","insurance","software","bugs"],"job_type":"full_time","publication_date":"2023-01-01T09:41:45","candidate_required_location":"USA","salary":"","description":"<div>At Human API, we exist to radically accelerate the pace of health innovation for everyone.

Slack instead of email. Miro instead of sticky notes. Airtable instead of Excel. SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.</p>\n<p>At Metomic, we help tech companies save time &amp; reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.</p>\n<p>Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio.
