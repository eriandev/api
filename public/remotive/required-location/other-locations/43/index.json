Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances. ONE’s vision is exceedingly simple and profound: to build one app that consumers use every day to manage all of their money. </p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">What makes us unique?
