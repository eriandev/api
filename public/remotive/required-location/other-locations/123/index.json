Much of this could be prevented with better access to specialist care. Take stroke as an example: any delay in treatment can lead to permanent disability or death. However, due to a lack of specialist surgeons, the most effective intervention can only be performed in 2% of US hospitals. For patients who present to one of the 98% of hospitals that do not offer the surgery, treatment is either significantly delayed or not offered at all because timely transfer is not feasible.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Our mission is to bring state-of-the-art vascular intervention to anyone, anytime, regardless of their location.
