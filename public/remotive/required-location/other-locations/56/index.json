So far, developers seem to like it!</div>\n<div>We are building a team of talented, thoughtful, and diverse people with the goal of making both front-end developers and website content creators more productive. We hope you can join us on this journey!</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong style=\"\">Introduction</strong></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Hello. We're Prismic.</div>\n<div>We're building a developer-centric CMS – like WordPress, but different (although that's a massive oversimplification). Our goal is to create a tool that is both enjoyable and productive for marketing &amp; development teams. In this job post, we will talk only about the latter. If you're interested in tools for marketers, it’s a different team, and you can still reach out!</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Many call us a headless CMS or API-based CMS, but we like to think beyond the technical architecture that we provide. We believe our job doesn't stop at providing an API to developers who will figure out how to work with it. That's why we're investing quite a lot in making the developer experience as enjoyable as possible and in building product and tools for developers.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong style=\"\">Why are we looking for you</strong><span style=\"\">?</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>We dedicate our time to making developers' jobs more accessible and productive. The developers’ end goal should be to provide tools for the marketing team to create as many pages as they want.</div>\n<div>To deliver this fully custom Website Builder, we created products for developers to efficiently develop website sections (we call them slices) using the technology of their choice. Gatsby, Nuxt, Next, Svelte, Php, Ruby, you name it.</div>\n<div>And that's where you come into play. We are looking for someone to help us develop and improve this product (Slice Machine) to make the jobs of the developers effortless and more enjoyable. Your goal will be to remove all the annoying bits of working with a Headless CMS and allow them to focus only on spaces where they shine.
