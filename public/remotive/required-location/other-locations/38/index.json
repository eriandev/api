Understanding how a developer's code changes the data, and coming up with new tests, using this knowledge, that may reveal a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Looking at server error logs to determine if a test is failing silently, or creating output in the error log that may reveal a new area that can be tested to identify a bug. </li> <li style=\"\">Look at the Javascript browser console to find errors that code may be silently generating, that could reveal a bug or other potential problem.</li> </ul><p><strong>Company Culture</strong></p><p>You'll work with a talented and highly-motivated team that is friendly, fast-moving, self-managing, and highly capable with a sense of humor.

There's no micro-­management here—we trust that you will see tasks through to completion and communicate with your fellow team members when needed or ask for help when needed.</p><p>At Defiant, ‘trust’ is the attribute we value most highly among our team members. We need to know that you can grab a task, communicate clearly with stakeholders, and see the task to completion with superb attention to detail.</p><p>We use apps like Slack, FogBugz, GitHub, and Google Apps for our workflow.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p>The Required Skills for this role are:</p><ul style=\"\"> <li style=\"\">Experience working as a QA Analyst.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience filing bugs and verifying fixes in a bug tracking system like Fogbugz.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience verifying bugs in a testing or staging environment, and sending them back to dev with helpful feedback, or marking them as fixed.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience testing PHP web applications.</li> <li style=\"\">Experience testing browser-based Javascript code.</li> <li style=\"\">Familiarity with accessing a SQL database using a SQL client, and knowledge of basic SQL is required.</li> <li style=\"\">Familiarity with Git and GitHub is required.
