We make it possible for anyone to make an impact on the elections that determine the balance of power in our country, by volunteering in and donating to key races.

You learn from your mistakes and believe in human potential. It's not that you can't overcome the challenge you're facing, it's just that you haven't overcome it yet. You appreciate the diverse thoughts and perspectives of your colleagues, partners and clients, and you are committed to actively listening and learning.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Getting things done.

You embrace the agile nature of design and development, and you are equally comfortable pivoting your plan and process as you are establishing a workback schedule. Try as we might, things won't always go as planned, and you always try to be ready to deal with that as it comes.</li>\n<li style=\"\">Passion for the problems we're solving. You understand how ecommerce and retail ecosystems are growing with emerging brands and solution providers, and you're keen to make an impact not just on the lives of customers, but on the businesses of our merchant partners and on the environment as well.
